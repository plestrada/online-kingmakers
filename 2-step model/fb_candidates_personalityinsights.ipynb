KUYA BONG GO, SATURDAY HOMETOWN DAVAO CITY FOR SOMEWHERE BROTHERS Kuya Bong apparently had a homecoming today, May 9, when he had a motorcade in Davao City where he chose to drive his hometown for the rest of the day campaign. Davao is special to Davao, so it is undeniable that Kuya Bong's motorcade along with his neighbors is long overdue. The motorcade started in very hot weather and people also greeted Kuya Bong warmly. Eventually, the weather became dark and it brought rain. Despite that, the designers still rained their support and love for their number one senatoriable.

GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST ILLUSTRATED DROGA, CONTINUOUS SUPPORT BY KUYA BONG GO Urge Kuya Bong to urge attendees of today's Change kick kick off campaign, March 6, to abstain from illegal drugs because they are not just unhealthy , it also disrupts the family. The event took place at the Olivarez College Coliseum, Paranaque City. In his speech, Kuya Bong also shared his legislative agenda. There is the building of the Care Centers, strengthening our agriculture, affordable housing for the poor, sports development, education, and more. Kuya Bong also urged residents to take care of our environment as it plays a major role in our development. All of these goals by Kuya Bong are just proof of his dedication to serve as a bridge for all Filipinos to the President and government services! #GoBongGO # Du34GO üëäüèºüáµüá≠ SO BONG GO, UNDERSTANDING THE ZAMBOANGA CITY ATTORNEY Kuya Bong shared his various legislative agendas with the Zamboange√±os and reminded them that he and Dad Digong loved them so much. This is proof of the Build Build Build projects for the city especially the expansion of the Zamboanga Fishport Complex that began when he was still the President's special assistant. Kuya Bong Go headed to Mayor Vitaliano D. Agan Coliseum of Zamboanga City for the Democratic-People's Party (PDP-LABAN) campaign yesterday, March 3, to meet and talk with Zamboangue√±os. He stated that he wished to improve and improve the lives of every Filipino through his legislative agendas, such as advancing agriculture and fishing especially one of the main occupations of the Zamboange√±os, localized peace talks for a more peaceful and tranquil cities, more Loving Centers and much more. Kuya Bong Go's service to every Filipino is a loving, loyal and caring service. It's just his vice. He will prioritize the well-being of every Filipino because he loves them very much. So in the coming election, let's go for GO! #GoBongGO # Du34GO üëäüèºüáµüá≠ 3RD GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE LEAGUE OF MUNICIPALITIES OF THE PHILIPPINES, WRITTEN BY HIMSELF AND SO BONG. Local officials play a vital role in every municipality especially as they become more aware of the problems in their area. Thus, when Kuya Bong attended the 3rd general assembly of the League of Municipalities of the Philippines held at the Manila Hotel yesterday, February 26, he expressed his admiration for local officials. He added that he supports officials willing to provide honest service because like Kuya Bong, he also promotes zero-tolerance to corruption. Kuya Bong is also a good example of these who are honest and not corrupt. From the time Father Digong was mayor until now, Kuya Bong has been faithful in his service. Even during this campaign season, she still prioritizes serving the needy. President Rodrigo Duterte also expressed his admiration for his former aide and now running for senator Kuya Bong. Dad Digong said he was very confident in Kuya Bong because even before that, no pesky pesos have been lost in his care. So let us expect his service to the people and to put the welfare of the people ahead of his own development. #GoBongGO # Du34GO üëäüèºüáµüá≠ VERY GOOD AND SO MUCH BONG GO, SHOWING SUPPORT FOR BARANGAY OFFICERS. Barangay officials from Presidents Rodrigo Duterte and Kuya Bong received their support during the 1st National Assembly of the Barangay League held yesterday, February 25, in Pasay City. At the meeting where Kuya Bong accompanied the President, Dad Digong said the village played a key role in maintaining peace and order in the country. Like Dad Digong, Kuya Bong has a lot of respect for the barangay officials. Thus, a major part of its legislative agenda is the promotion of Magna Carta for barangay officials. When implemented, like other government staff, barangay officials, bodyguards, barangay health workers and the Youth Council will receive adequate benefits and wages. With the assistance of Dad Digong and Kuya Bong, it is surely the well-being of our barangay officials who provide Tatut Duterte services to our communities. And with the help of Kuya Bong, their problems and grievances will be met by the government as he is the bridge of all Filipinos to the President! #GOPHILIPPINESGO # DU34GO #GOBONGGO A major blow to a family's life is to be homeless due to fire or any disaster. Not only does this serve as our protection, but it also houses many important memories of our home. So Aunt Bong Go knows how much it hurts for flammers to lose their home. As such, Kuya Bong said during his visit to the fire victims in Brgy. 898, To Sta. Ana, Manila said she would contact government agencies such as PCSO, PAGCOR and NHA to provide them with assistance and assistance so that they can recover and help rebuild their homes. This is just proof of Kuya Bong's vow to serve as a bridge to the Filipino people in the President. In addition, Kuya Bong's legislative agenda is also part of his running as a senator in promoting a sound and effective housing program for Filipinos, especially in these instances when the homes of some families are affected by accidents or disasters. As a show of support for his advocacy, a supporter and friend of Kuya Bong will also distribute food to the fire victims. Brutal Service Duterte with genuine concern - that's what Kuya Bong brings to our fellow victims of disasters and tragedies. There is no alley or corner that will not budge, serve only its fellow Filipinos and provide heartfelt service! #GoBongGO # Du34GO üëäüèºüáµüá≠","count":1},{"name":"My countrymen, the sovereign will to change the system of government is in your capacity to choose your leaders.

Poverty Resulting from Bad Politics That our nation is poor is an economic fact and problem. But we are poor largely because of the bad kind of politics prevailing in our country.  Politics determines who will lead us and those who lead us determine the kind of economic model our society will have.   The kind of leaders that Philippine politics has put in public office have, as their priority objective, to enrich only themselves, and not the nation as a whole whereby all may benefit. In fact, our being a poor nation is the reason why our economic elite succeed in controlling our politics and consequently dominating our society.   Poverty breeds poor health and insufficient education.  People whose health is ailing and who lack education are vulnerable to the manipulation and intimidation employed by the economic elite in order to gain and consolidate their political power. 2. Corrupt Officials‚ÄîOld and New Many of the instances of corruption committed during the past administration were schemes of a faction of our elite whose social and political clout was guaranteed by their capacity to effectively manipulate our electoral system.   The same faction of the elite manipulated the last election for the current President, and the leaders of this faction, as a reward for their crime, have been admitted into the President‚Äôs circle of influence and given a major share of power in government and in politics in general. No wonder that corruption has started quite early under this administration.  Moreover the unfolding schemes of corruption are actually improved and enhanced versions of past practices. Worse, factions of newcomers are in a race to steal as much as they can while the nation is still mesmerized by the ongoing anti-corruption circus. 3. Current Politics a Sad and Dangerous Reality The reality of our current politics is sad and dangerous.  Many of our leaders are part of the economic elite whose main interest is to protect their own.   Today they are factionalized and bereft of a valid unifying cause.  The President‚Äôs and its allies in the House and in the Senate is a hastily built alliance of political personalities whose only commonality is the desire to be identified with the present holders of state power and thus be able to get a share of the usual benefits accruing to clients of the big patrons in Malaca√±ang and Congress. Other political groups of the traditional kind engage in criticism of the incumbent administration mainly for purposes of acquiring political leverage to extract benefits or to avoid prosecution. 4. Free Our Country from Selfish Elite The Philippines is a poor, Third World country.    We have not become a First World country in the best sense of the term, because we have not firmly decided to become one.   We have tolerated the prolonged grip of the economic elite on political power that has kept us poor and prevented our becoming prosperous as nation. Prosperity, though within the parameters of sustainable development, is a universal human right.   While prosperity is a universal human right, the basic means to pursue it have become the exclusive instruments of the economic elite and their cronies.   Practically all the instrumentalities governing Philippine society have been effectively captured and controlled by our elite, making it impossible to direct the course of our national endeavors toward the attainment of prosperity for all the people. We have to free the nation from the total stranglehold of our economic elite.   It should not be that our choice of leaders for our nation is between traditional vested interests of the administration bet, on one hand, and the Liberal Party bet, on the other hand. #13 BERNARD F.

Filipinos should be taught Chinese and other foreign languages to ensure that foreigners do not take away their jobs, senatorial candidate Rafael \"Raffy\" Alunan said Saturday. Asked what the government should do to ensure that Filipinos are not denied jobs amid the influx of Chinese workers in the Philippines, Alunan, who is endorsed by President Rodrigo Duterte, said the country's educational system should be improved by teaching foreign languages in schools. \"In our education, we should be multi-lingual, we should know Chinese, we should know Japanese, we should know English, so that we can take the place of these people who are taking out our Filipinos, and our Filipino-Chinese in our own country,\" he said during the CNN Philippines Senatorial Debate. \"If we have enough Filipinos talking and speaking in Chinese and in other languages, we'll be able to prevent foreigners from working in our country,\" he added. Aside from education, Alunan said, the government should also \"revive our agriculture, manufacturing, and our tourism, so we can get as many jobs as possible and livelihood opportunities.\" ‚ö´Ô∏è #7 sa balota ‚Äî RAFFY ALUNAN #AlunanSaSenado #TunayNaKwalipikado #ComfortableLifeForAll Source: http://cnnphilippines.com/‚Ä¶/raffy-alunan-foreign-languages-‚Ä¶ A BIG THANK YOU!

It's work-in-progress and is only as fast as the resistance and timidity it's encountering from the criminal, corrupt and apathetic in government and in society.  No, the President has not fallen asleep on asserting the country's sovereignty and sovereign rights in the West Philippine Sea. He has his own balanced way of dealing with it, not your confrontational way that's counterproductive to our independent foreign policy and principles of smart diplomacy.    No, the administration is not going to fall into a debt trap. It's not stupid and very much aware of what happened in Sri Lanka and other parts of the world like the Near East and Africa. Your accusations are speculative, what I call anticipatory negativism, which is another way of spreading untruths.  C'mon guys, I know all of you and I know you can do much, much better than that. Instead of hitting personalities, unveil your platforms that will benefit the people. Let the people choose on the basis of that positive approach instead of poisoning the atmosphere for self-gain.   Remember we are here for the people, not for ourselves. And regardless of the outcome, remember that we are Team Philippines, One Philippines whose duty is to build a new and better country for all Filipinos.  HUA?

But at these times it is more important for me to personally see the situation of my Cabalen in Pampanga being greatly affected by yesterday's quake in the province. Together with the Philippine Red Cross, DPWH and other government sectors, we are very sympathetic to the victims. There is no effective weapon at this time but PRAYER and HELP. #BANGONPampanga What we need in the senate, DO NOT WORD!

Raffy Alunan, # 7 on the ballot! #RaffyAlunan #AlunanSaSenado As of May 13, 2019, what the people really need is the real qualifier - RAFFY PUBLIC SERVICE! # Elections2019 #AlunanSaSenado The Ultimate QUALIFICATION OF THE SENATE! # 7 on Ballot !!! #RAFFYALUN President Duterte once said: \"He is the most important person in the Senate!\" Raffy Alunan on Juvenile justice: Hold parents accountable \"Whether you are talking of 18 years old or 15 years old or 12 or 9, the important thing is for the parents to be very much involved in protecting their young and make sure they don't get into trouble. I think that whether the age limit is lowered to 12 or 9, I think the parents should be held accountable,\" said Alunan. He then acknowledged that the state of youth care facilities, where juvenile delinquents are supposed to be rehabilitated, are poor and squalid. Alunan said civil society should work closely with the government to improve the squalid conditions of these institutions. Alunan recalled once helping Bahay Pag-asa, a juvenile center in La Salle Bacolod. \"And I think we should do that all over the country, civil society and government working together,\" said Alunan. #RaffyAlunan #AlunanSaSenado I do not have the machinery or funds available for my candidacy, but I am willing to sacrifice my commitment and fulfill it whenever I make a promise. Because for me a true servant in the town would make way for his obligation and not think for his own sake. Salamat YOUNG USON BLOG !!!!! #RaffyAlunan #AlunanSaSenado Vote for the candidate who knows the person, NOT the candidate you only know when you need a VOTE. Raffy Alunan is approachable and willing to help those in need even before they are hired. At the height of the Marawi Seige, Manong #RaffyAlunan was one of the brave footprints in Marawi to offer a medical mission in conjunction with the Rotary Club of Manila. If he was a private citizen who cared for those in need, how much more so when he became a citizen, he also deserved it because surely in his heart was the love of Mother Laya and Juan Dela Cruz. #RaffyWorks #WorksWorks #Newly Qualified Thanks Negrense!

At their young age this is what they are supposed to be doing, PLAYING AND LOVING A CHILD. They are the reason I struggle to return to the service of the town because I see that every day many children sacrifice their freedom to play and to be children in poverty because the funds they deserve go to a few selfish ones. So our vote on MAY 13, is very important because if we want them to experience being young, don't let the country just fall into poverty. Vote for the right place!

To hear the plight of our countrymen, I personally visited the Surigao public market. The problem is not just the price of the goods but also the planned privatization of the market. Should the so-called PUBLIC MARKET be personalized? So it is only right that we vote for those who serve us honestly and non-abusively only for the sake of our own sake and not the Filipino people.

I'm with you in the fight for the sake of Mother Laya and Juan de la Cruz because my fight is against us, the Filipino Family. LIFE PRESIDENT RODRIGO DUTERTE! To my fellow candidates running for national, congressional and local office: Regardless of party affiliation, the main reason why we are running for public office is to support the Filipino Family and fight for the interests of our beloved Philippines. After the elections, we must all come together as one nation, as One Philippines, to help win the future for our young and succeeding generations. We must unite in order to fight and suppress everything that destroys the Filipino Family and Motherhood - injustice and corruption that produce poverty, criminality, rebellion and armed insurgencies. We cannot hope to build a nation if we are that way, if we do not change our habit of blocking the future of our people. Our unity begins with our families. The success I'm looking for, let's say, is the success of the Filipino Family. Our country is one. We have only one blood. We have only one flag. Let's love our country. Unite! It's so nice to be together! I am Raffy Alunan, No. 7 on the ballot for the Senate.

May more people know what kind of a man my father is before the May elections. #prouddaughter Rafael Alunan III 4 political reforms needed badly:  1.) ban surveys from going public to prevent mind-conditioning. 2.) gov't should spend for the candidate's mass media exposure to level the playing field.  3.) specify qualification standards for specific positions sought in the gov't. criteria differ for various positions just like the way it's done in the private sector. 4.) political parties should be guided strictly by such criteria in selecting their candidates. The country's future is tied to our vote that we expect to be properly counted. Vote wisely. Choose only those who have sincerely served the country and people in various capacities. Maayong buntag sa akoang mga igsoon na Cebuano!  #daghangSalamatCebumediamen #7saBalota #AlunanSaSenado Ano nga ba ang \"Alunan Doctrine\"?

My father, Eleuterio Alfajora was one of thousands of world war 2 veterans at that time they sang the US national anthem, star spangled banner under US flag, a war between Allies and Axis . He shot down plane, gave map to Lt Ferdinand Marcos! Traveling places where he went  makes realize how hard life during the war!!

Name calling is not kind. Both could have missed points. This reminds me of father who heard me in my commentaries of the late President which may appear to my point of view a balance way of seeing things. He said, the late President was my superior reported him in Leyte whatever information drawing maps of the Japanese Camps I gather from Negros, Cebu,  Bohol to Leyte while selling them sugar at their camps. I knew him in person. Your saying he could have his Maharlika guerrilla after his stint in the Visayas at that time when we where together in the Visayas.  An intelligence officer like him could not gave that band of fighter. What Atty Gadon and students could not have known are facts of private transactions of accounts and the precious metals.  I mean it's not all about public funds as Atty Gadon may attempt to drive at. Its the private transaction as a sovereign head of state with precious metals  using some private accounts as a holder of Special Powers of Attorney. That is the main issue.  How the international powers attempt to get back  the precious metals left in the country as results of wars. YOUSCOOPER: WHY SENATOR ALFAJORA IS AGAINST POLITICAL DYNASTY? Why I am here? Did I plan it? Not and never by human perspective its accident by divine perspective its provident. But I pray that I will be declared nuisance due to lacks of funds. If it is providential maybe the time is not now; but this exercise set me to the next level.  But still anything can happen. I have enemies in the system and social structures. I am not here to deconstruct you but the system. Just listen what General Almonte said, \"The elite must listen their conscience! #Pederalismo #iRechargeAngSenado #ParaSaPagbabago We have better tools to bring solution of the problems. Our experience, and knowledge of issues of urban poor make an Evangeline Roche Abejo No. 1 and Richard U. Alfajora No. 6 in senate slate the last card of the urban poor nationwide, farmers, workers and all 14 basic sectors. No candidate other than us has better knowledge how land grabbing make us poor, how regionalization wage makes poverty steal the salary and growth of the countryside. One state, one currency, one tax rate but regionalized wage ay simply a strategy of poverty this government established. Andam na ba mong magklarohay?

RECORDING SENADO, Richard 3.1 Alfajora will vote # 6 on the ballot for federalism and change. #Bisdak #ProudCebuano #ProudBisaya #Federalism #Senador This is Mr. FB! spay talaga !. Every open day. Immediately ask: What is in your mind? Mr FB I'm off for 2019 on Sunday March 3 eh that bumps me off, who and what producers only know. It's just mates. I've had some serious issues and challenges over the last few days. I challenge all incumbents and returning senators (naming them on air) to a debate on federalism and the laws they have made. I challenge the systems, The oligarchs holding the media are the control valves of public information thus rising senatorial oligarchs and the alipuris of the oligarchy in public perception in the survey so that on social media by MR FB we are more free against the oligarchy. Thank you Mr. Mark Zuckerberg. The battle and struggle continue with fiery remorse for the people. National anthem! I don't know, if TV guesting is a privilege extended to candidates or a right provided by our laws saying media shall give candidates air time free of charge. If it is a right, I can claim it base on law ; if it is a privilege , it is subject to human will.   I am saying that since I received a call from the one contacted me to attend the Harapan 2019 that  I am not part of guest this March 3 , 2019 edition. And that there is no assurance of a schedule for next week. Question arise on ethics if it were a privilege.  But friends are saying that maybe someone who were absent in that past get inserted to my place. They can't adjust chair and time. But some also thought my statements against mainstream media  owned by oligarchs that control information as a part of survey problems considering candidates on the top are either oligarchs or alipuris of oligarchs to serve the business interests jaya bumabagal ang federalism din dahil niyan. I am sorry to my supporters and I ask your prayers. One day God give them response to the experience we do. She said, my confirmation weeks past are late. I disagreed. Humility is a virtue !

Iyon ang dahilan kung bakit kahit may karamdaman, pinipilit niyang bumangon ng maaga para ikampanya tayo.

Join us in the discussion! Let's use #HilbaySaSenado on social media! Let's do this, team Hilbay! Kahapon, nagpunta tayo sa Nueva Ecija at Bulacan. Naimbitahan tayo sa College for Research and Technology. Spoke in front of our young graduates and told them to serve the country in their own little ways, wherever they are.  Pagkatapos noon, tumakbo tayo ng Bulacan para ma-meet ang ating supporters and volunteer groups na gumagawa ng lakad kampanya on their own.

Ilang beses ko nang nabanggit kay Agot na may mga araw na ang bigat ng kampanya. Kapag nakausap mo ang mga tao sa baba at malaman ang problema nila, parang iyong mga pinoproblema natin ay napakababaw kumpara sa kanilang pagdurusa.  Kaya kagabi, lumipad siya papuntang CDO. Sinamahan niya ako ngayon sa Marawi upang dalawin ang Most Affected Area (aka Ground Zero) at para makausap ang mga komunidad ng bakwit sa lugar.  Maraming nagkuwento ng mga hinaing - ang mga rasyon na binibigay sa kanila ay bulok na pagkain, sawa na sila sa sardinas, may discrepancy sa pinangakong tulong at halagang natatanggap nila.  Our team dedicated 7 days to go around Mindanao. Hindi iyon sapat, at alam kong kailangang bumalik.  Maraming events ang tahimik lang, dahil gusto nating magbabad at makipag-usap sa mga komunidad. Alam kong nasa kampanya tayo, pero naniniwala ako na ang kampanyang nakasentro sa pagbabalik ng dignidad sa tao ay isang kampanyang handang manahimik upang magkaroon ng boses ang mga pinatahimik ng sistema. #37PiloHilbay #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏è After 3 years! Finally! This is what increased public dissatisfaction to our policy in dealing with China does. This proves that our dissent is the right strategy.  This proves that we should never be silent.

Isa ang panawagan: natatakot sila para sa kinabukasan, at kailangan ng isang Senadong hindi magsisinungaling,  magnanakaw, at magiging sunud-sunuran sa Malakanyang.

Chel Diokno and Neri Colmenares. Pinag-usapan namin ang ipinanalo nating arbitral ruling sa kaso natin laban sa Tsina. Dati may magjejetski raw para ipagtanggol ang teritoryo natin, pero ngayon halos angkin na angkin na ito ng China. Pati trabaho ng mga kababayan, kinuha na.  Hindi raw natin maeenforce ang desisyon dahil makapangyarihan ang China, pero sa dubious deals sa Chico at Kaliwa Dam, rule of law ang depensa kung bakit di tayo lolokohin ng mga dayuhan. 'Yun ang lokohan. #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado Sinamahan ako ni Agot at mga volunteers sa palengke ng Marikina kanina. When we were planning this market visit, siya mismo ang nag-prisintang sumama, dahil sa Marikina siya lumaki. Salamat sa pa-breakfast, bossing!  Maraming salamat sa lahat ng volunteers na nagpunta! Ulitin natin 'to sa mga susunod na araw. PS May nagbigay ng llanera ng \"everlasting\" (a type of food na sikat sa Marikina) kay Agot kanina. Bale, dalawang everlasting ang kasama niya kanina. Iyong isa, hindi nauubos. #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado‚òùÔ∏è Good morning, Cebu! We are spinning in the villages now. This afternoon, we are at USC for a forum. I hope to meet you all in the next two days! # 37HilBAI #HilbaySaSenado \"I look at this world I‚Äôm struggling to stay in and feel only despair. The despot Filipinos elected to the presidency has infected the populace with a malignance unmatched by the deadliest of cancers. As tumors have spread to most of my organs, so have his poisonous politics invaded practically every branch of government ‚Äî the well-entrenched system of checks and balances now applicable only to your personal bank account.\" Kasama mo kami sa parehong laban, Twink. #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado My statement regarding the case filed before the ICC against Xi Jinping: I express my unequivocal support to former SFA Del Rosario and Ombudsman Carpio-Morales, and the hundreds of thousands of Filipino fishermen who are victims of environmental damage in China's quest to solely and fully occupy the South China Sea.  All these transgressions done by the Chinese government were possible because of a single reason: the Duterte administration failed to protect our sovereignty when they refused to defend the Tribunal's decision in the case we won against China last July 2016. Instead, this government welcomed China within our shores and allowed it to militarize artificial islands over our territories, refuse our fishermen access to their livelihood, and let illegal Chinese workers steal jobs that were supposed to be for Filipinos.  The move to hold a hegemon accountable using the rule of law manifests that ordinary Filipinos can defend our sovereignty, and that our people can come together to hold power into account. If this government will not defend us and our future generations from China's occupation and destruction of our resources, we will. #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado‚òùÔ∏è For his part, former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay said the MWSS had a clear ‚Äúfailure of oversight‚Äù in addressing the water shortage. ‚ÄúThe part of government, I think there is a clear failure of oversight,‚Äù Hilbay said in the press conference. #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado‚òùÔ∏è This morning, I visited in the New East. It took a while to get around and introduce to the countrymen. Your quota of people buying NFA rice, is long. I talked to others, and they said they still had trouble eating at the table. At the multi-sectoral meeting earlier, many reminded me that because I had their problems too, I would never forget to win, as some have faced. # 37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏è ‚ÄúIt is very crucial therefore that we elect public officials who are principled, courageous, and who have the common good as their main concern and not their own political interests.‚Äù #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado‚òùÔ∏è Good morning!

Ready na ako sa pakbet, miki, at empanada!  #Pilokano #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏è Plane to Isabela went back to Manila yesterday. Pagdating sa airport, naghanap ng flight to Tuguegarao - na-cancel rin. Decided to travel by land instead. 11 hours of driving, isang beses lang tumigil. Hindi pwedeng 'di dalawin ang Gattaran, Cagayan, where my mom's family is from. Sabi sa interview kanina may isa pa palang \"Son of the North\" na tumatakbo. Tama po. My fondest memory of Cagayan is swimming in Cagayan River, which we call \"Carayan,\" kasama ang mga utol at pinsan ko. Sabi nung isang political video recently: The North Remembers. Agpayso! As a proud son of the North, I #NeverForget. #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado‚òùÔ∏è Grabi. Parang mas nakakagising pa 'to sa kape! Andami kong nakilala. Andami kong kuwentong narinig na nagpakirot ng puso ko - kuwento ng pagtitiis, ng abuso, ng takot, ng pagsisisi, ng pangarap, at ng paninindigan. Napakarami ko ring pasasalamat: Salamat sa pagsugal niyo sa akin sa laban na ito. Salamat sa lahat ng tulong na naibigay niyo sa ating kampanya.  Higit sa lahat, salamat sa pagmamahal niyo sa bayan!  Ibang klaseng katatagan ang mayroon ang mga kababayan natin sa Hong Kong. Para sa mga pangarap natin para sa Pilipinas, lalaban tayo!  #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏è Habang nasa biyahe tayo kanina papuntang Hong Kong, sinama nung utol kong si Miage ang ilan sa team para mag flyering at postering sa Smokey Mountain. Si Ewing naman, isinabak ulit namin sa isang speaking engagement para sa ARYA-NAFLU. Si Ate Nanette, ina ng isang EJK victim at isang volunteer sa kampanya naman ang nagsalita sa Alterpolitics. Iyong dati naming intern sa OSG, kaka-volunteer lang this week, pero spoke on my behalf na rin sa St. Scho Manila.  At mamaya, may pa-Captain Marvel ang UST EHS batchmates ko para makatulong sa kampanya. Salamat! Ito talaga ang all hands on deck! #HILBAYanihan #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏è Dumiretso ako ng Pampanga para sa isang speaking engagement after ng interview with Karen Davila sa Makati. Napaaga ng kaunti kaya nag-lunch muna sa Clark. Nung paalis na tayo, biglang hinabol nung guwardiya. Medyo kinabahan ako! Inisip ko tuloy kung nakapagbayad ba ako o hindi. Supporter pala. Taga Moriones dati, malapit sa amin sa Tondo. Sabi niya: \"Yung talino mo dapat ang nakaupo sa Senado, para tumino naman at mabawasan ang mga magnanakaw!\"  Parang ganito ang naririnig nating sentimiyento lately. #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏èI went straight to Pampanga for a speaking engagement after interview with Karen Davila in Makati. A little early so had lunch at the Clark. When we were about to leave, the guard suddenly chased them. I was a bit nervous! I thought if I had paid or not. So it's a supporter. From Moriones before, near us in Tondo. He said: ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ Your intellect should be the one sitting in the Senate, to behave well and reduce thieves!\" It seems like this is what we've been hearing lately. #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏è True naman. Pero, naku, sir. Lahat ng pinakamayayamang tumatakbo, nasa hanay ninyo. Lahat ng mga pinakamahihirap na kandidato - iyong bumababa sa tao, iyong alam ang sentimiyento ng maralita, iyong galing talaga sa mga minorya - hindi niyo kaalyado.  So, anuna. #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏è Kung kantahan ang labanan, eh sana sa Tawag ng Tanghalan na lang ho tayong lahat nagpunta, di'ba? #37Hilbay #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏è Mr. President, ang minorya na hindi nagbibigay ng kritisismo sa administrasyon ay tuta, hindi oposisyon.  Hanggang may Pilipinong nagugutom, naghihirap at tinatanggalan ng kalayaan, at hanggang ang mga teritoryo natin ay ipinamimigay sa ibang bansa, titindig ho tayo at ang buong Otso Diretso - kahit sino pa ang nakaupo.  #HilbaySaSenado #37Hilbay Naimbitahan kagabi bilang guest speaker sa 25th founding anniversary ng University of St. La Salle - Bacolod College of Law. Was able to reconnect with former students and staff of the OSG. Lagi't lagi, ang prinsipiyong sinasandigan natin: batas na may hustisya, paglilingkod sa bayan, at pagtuturo. Lahat ng ito ay pagbabantay sa obligasyon ng ating mga abugado na protektahan ang mga mamamayan, at palayain ang ating bayan. ‚òùÔ∏è #HilbaySaSenado May nagsisinungaling sa educational attainment, tapos may nagsasabing walang nakaw na yaman. Ano 'to, combo meal? ‚òùÔ∏è #RevisionistsOverload Whether a person has a diploma or not is not the heart of this issue. Ang pagtakbo bilang kandidato ay dapat bukas sa lahat - nakatapos ka man o hindi. Ang dapat pag-usapan ay ang paulit-ulit at tahasang pagsisinungaling sa bayan. Kung  educational attainment nga lang pinepeke na, ano pa kaya sa mas malalaking bagay? ‚òùÔ∏è #NeverAgainWhether a person has a diploma or not the heart of this issue. Running as a candidate must be open to all - whether you have done it or not. What should be talked about is repeated and explicitly lying to the nation. If it's just educational attainment already fake, what could it be bigger things? ‚òùÔ∏è #NeverAgain Our last stop in Bacolod yesterday was in Sitio Tinago, Brgy. Banago. Nakilala ko si Lola Rosalie, binabagsakan siya ng tahong para kunin ang laman nito.  Sabi niya, ang isang \"Caltex\" ng tahong ay binibili sa halagang 6 pesos. Nakaka 60 pesos siya sa isang araw. Pambili ng kalahating kilong bigas at ulam. Kilala niya ang #OtsoDiretso. Gusto niya na karamihan sa amin ay bago. Hindi na raw siya boboto nung mga lumang naging dahilan ng pagtaas ng presyo ng mga bilihin. Until real empowerment and justice are achieved, the need for EDSA - the need for vigilance, dissent, and protest - remains. ‚òùÔ∏è #HilbaySaSenado G. Sino gagawa ng event? ‚òùÔ∏è #HilbaySaSenado 02-19-19 Happy Land, Helping Land, Aroma, Parola. Ilan sa mga pinakamahihirap na lugar sa Tondo. Nakipag-dialogue sa mga pamilya, lalu na iyong may PWDs at senior citizens. Mas mainit ang pagtanggap pag nalalamang galing sa Tundo. Mas ramdam rin ang pakiusap: huwag kang makakalimot, di gaya ng halos lahat ng pulitikong dumaan dito. Ang \"hapilan\" sa Bisaya loosely translates to \"dump site.\" Sa mahihirap, kadalasan sa pangalan at ilusyon na lang ang pagiging masaya. Nakakadurog. But \"apilan\" can also mean \"to include.\" Iyon ang dahilan ng paglaban nating ito. ‚òùÔ∏è #HilbaySaSenado Si Jenny. 22 years na siya sa Happy Land, Tondo. Sabi niya antagal niyang naging scavenger, basurera, at street sweeper.  Pero ngayon, kahit kadalasan kapos, nagpapa-feeding program sa mga bata tuwing weekend. Hindi maipagawa iyong harapan ng bahay, kasi inuuna ang iba. Minsan, kung sino pa ang pinaka-hikahos, sila pa ang pinaka-nagbibigay sa komunidad. Nakipagkilala siya kasi ako lang raw ang nakita niyang national candidate na hindi nagdala ng pulis nung bumisita rito. ‚òùÔ∏è Arrived 30 mins ahead of our first appointment today, kaya nagpakilala muna ako sa mga taga Pier 18. Sanay na ang mga tao dito sa mga namumulitika, at pakiramdam nila na lagi na lang silang nagagamit. Hindi ko sila masisisi kung may duda sila sa lahat ng pulitiko. Kaming mga tumatakbo ang kailangang bumuo muli sa kanilang tiwala. Kaya nung nasagot ko mga tanong nila tungkol sa mga kalsada ng Tundo at mga sangkap ng goto, game na silang makipag-tropahan! Good morning! ‚òùÔ∏è #HilbaySaSenado Paano mapaparami ang mga doktor sa mga pinakamalalayong lugar sa bansa? Ilagay sa educational system ang Doctors to the Barrios Program. #Harapan2019 #HilbaySaSenado ‚òùÔ∏è \"As for Hilbay, Robredo said his rags-to-riches story as a Tondo boy who became solicitor general is \"napaka-inspiring\" (very inspiring).\" Maraming salamat, VP Leni! Karangalan sa akin na pagtiwalaan at ma-endorso ng isa sa pinakamagaling at pinakamatinong lingkod-bayan na nabubuhay ngayon. ‚òùÔ∏è Live tayo ngayon sa Tundo! Let's go! #HILBAYanihan #HilbaySaSenado Iyong pulis bawal raw i-video tapos ang dahilan niya \"because I said so.\" Lokohan. Uy, si Agot. Thanks. üòç Totoo ngang walang pangarap na imposible. Hehe This is a paid advertisement by Julz Esquivias, Ehome Center VV Soliven St, Cainta. Ready na tayo sa tatlong buwang pagpapagod, dahil kasama ko sa laban ang aking energy booster!

I know how you tend to be harsh to your critics, especially those who have expressed dissent to your policies and public pronouncements.  Maraming salamat po, Mr. President, sa iyong paggalang sa aking pagkababae. And I also ask you to afford the same respect to all women, as we celebrate National Women's Month this March. The president we saw yesterday was the same president I pledged to work for before. I know that you will be a better president and a great father to this nation if you will just learn to temper your words to the occasion and revisit your anti-poor policies. Which brings me to my next order of business: I appeal to your better senses to stop the 'bloodier' drug war for the second half of your presidency.  Mr. President, I respect your drug war, pero ang kailangan po natin ay drug war laban sa mga druglords at drug war kontra sa source ng droga. We should work for better enforcement. Nandoon pa din ang droga sa ating mga komunidad, dahil hindi naman nahuhuli ang mga pinanggagalingan nito, ang mga sources. Instead, we should fight drugs and its source. At napatunayan na po natin na kaya naman ang isang deathless drug war. Nagawa po sa ilang bahagi ng bansa, kaya po nating gawin sa buong Pilipinas. At nasaan po ang ayuda para sa mga biktima na pawang naka-shorts at naka-tsinelas? Nasaan po ang mga dapat na improvements para mapabilis ang hustisya sa ating bansa? At nasaan po ang accountability ng mga nakibahagi sa mga drug operations na nakapatay ng mga walang laban at inosente? Let us move on from this nightmare and start building peace in our nation. Karahasan po ang itinuturo natin sa ating mga musmos, at sa karahasan po sila pupunta. We must raise children who will love and work for peace, not ones who are desensitized to violence and will continue to perpetuate this vicious cycle. Kinabukasan po ng ating bayan ang nakataya dito, kaya marubdob po akong nakikiusap na itigil na po natin ang pagkitil sa buhay ng mga taong dapat po ay tulong ang ating pinapaabot at hindi bala. This is an important juncture in your presidency, Sir President Duterte. I implore you, as a fellow Mindanaoan and as a man who shares the same blood of a Maranaw, to choose peace, put a stop to this mindless killings, and set our country on a course to a better, peaceful future.  #SamiraGutoc #SamiraSaSenado I would like to thank Bulacan State University for hosting us during the Bulacan State University Forum held last March 1, 2019.

Ang Pilipinas ay isang bansa na may \"Lupang Hinirang\". Nakapaganda ng ating kalupaan, kabukiran, at kabundukan at napakasagana sa mga iba't ibang klase ng \"Mineral at Likas Na Yaman\". Mayrun tayong sapat na suplay ng malinis na TUBIG, sariwang HANGIN, magandang sikat ng ARAW, napakagandang kaLUPAan... Marahil lahat tayo ay naniniwala at nagtatanong kung bakit:  \"Napakayaman ng Bansang Pilipinas, Ngunit Bakit Naghihirap ang Mayorya ng Mamamayang Pilipino\"...  Sa aking palagay, may nagaganap na maling \"SISTEMA\" at may mga nanunungkulan sa ating pamahalaan na hindi kapakanan ng taong-bayan at ng Bansa ang kanilang pinangangalagaan kundi ang interes ng kani-kanilang pamilya, negosyo, at pinagkakautangan ng loob kung bakit sila ay nalagay sa posisyon sa gubyerno, sa madaling salita, mayrun din maling \"LIDERATO\" at klase ng mga namumuno sa gubyerno.  Kung ganun, paulit-ulit mang maganap ang eleksyon kada ikatlo o ikaanim na taon sa ilalim ng 1987 Constitution, hinding-hindi magbabago ang kalagayan ng mayoryang Pilipino. Ang mga politiko ay paulit-ulit lang tayong gagamitin at papangakuan tuwing eleksyon pero hindi naman sosolusyunan ang tunay na ugat ng kahirapan. Ako, si Emily T.

We have enough supply of clean WATER , fresh WIND, beautiful sunlight, what a great LAND... Perhaps we all believe and ask why: \"The Philippines country is so rich, but why the Filipino people suffer\"... I think there is a wrong \"SYSTEM\" happening and there are incumbent in our government that are not the welfare of the people and the country they care of but the interests of their families, business, and creditor why they are put in government position, in other words, there is also a wrong \"LEADERATO\" and class of government leaders. If so, the election will happen repeatedly every third or sixth year under the 1987 Constitution, the situation of the Filipino people will never change. Politicians will only use us repeatedly and promise during elections but the real root of poverty is not solved. Me, Emily T.

Engineers like you create the foundation for change in the Philippines and it is science, technology and innovation that will drive our country to a brighter future. We sincerely hope we can work with your sector soon! FEBRUARY 28, 2019 So glad to be one of the mentors again at the recently held Go Business Mentor Me On Wheels last Thursday at the Lucky Chinatown Mall in Binondo, Manila. Even before I was a Senator, we are already supporting the Go Business because of our Hapinoy Program and because we believe that every Filipino family that wants to do business also has the opportunity to help our country grow. Until our next mentorship! :) * The Mentor Me On Wheels is a program that introduces mentors to micro and small entrepreneurs, and offers technical know-how and practical entrepreneurship strategies. FEBRUARY 28, 2019 Thank you to the people of Barangay 105, Tondo, Manila for your warm welcome to my visit yesterday. You can count on us to continue to fight for the well-being of every Filipino family. Because I believe that whatever the state of life, whether rich or poor, we should treat our fellow Filipinos fairly. We treat each other with dignity, respect, and appreciation. Our dream is to be a prosperous town with nothing left. #BAMSaSenado P.S.

FORMER senator Jinggoy Estrada is batting for a package of measures meant to provide womb-to-tomb benefits for the nation's poorest of the poor, which constitutes 20 percent of the population -- one of every five Filipinos is dirt-poor. \"Fishermen, farmers, and children of the poor remain caught in the stranglehold of abject misery, eking an existence on a scant P50 for their daily needs. We are a Christian nation and whatever we do to the least of our brethren, we do that to God,\" Estrada said.  He pointed to the children of poor families \"that are the most vulnerable sector, since daily hunger robs them of their quota of intellect that touches off learning disabilities and reduced capacity to gain competencies for work.\" Rather than craft piecemeal approaches for poverty reduction, Estrada said \"a comprehensive, long-term strategy must be established as legislative agenda to bring down poverty to the irreducible minimum -- this is what we seek to attain in the provision of womb-to-tomb benefits for the poorest of the poor.\" \"It is not enough that we provide money dole-outs, we must also have a survey of whatever skills that those in the poverty threshold possess -- and we must use such skills for needful services to the community where the poor are. Indeed, we should create the opportunities in which we can employ the poor,\" he added. Estrada said that in any government office, \"a daily average of 35 needy people would seek help, mostly money support for their sick, their dead, or their newborn or job recommendations -- and an informal survey of such people would provide insights what lawmakers need to craft to help them out in the long-term.\" He said he would be filing the womb-to-tomb measure once he gets re-elected but this early, he has already plunged into focus group discussions with experts and resource persons with a view to crafting his pet measure.  https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1798975 #29naEstrada #AnakngMasa #SenatorJinggoyEstrada2019 Due to RA 9547 or the SPES (Special Program for the Employment of Students) Law nearly 169,246 students have been employed that have already helped with their education expenses.

Please know your rights as Filipino Workers! # 29naEstrada #LaborandEmployment #AnakngMasa # 29saBALOTA # SenatorJinggoyEstrada2019 This is my first Father and Son moment with Mayor Erap in the past.

You will also post a picture with your father or mother who will always support you! # 29naEstrada #AnakngMasa # SenatorJinggoyEstrada2019 Panuorin! ANCHOR: What will you do in the Senate if you get the chance to come back? SEN. JUNE: We will give our countrymen a dignified job in our country. Instead of working abroad in Saudi Arabia in Kuwait, you know it's difficult to separate a family home from their family. I would prefer that they just work here in our country. Most of them are being exploited by their boss, beaten, bullied, raped, and other employers are not paid on time. ANCHOR: What is the key to being a RATINGS fan? SEN. JUNE: I attribute it to our performance for 12 years. We have many laws in place, and we have many laws that have been passed and have become law. We have been active in deliberations in the Senate. In turn, we are working on SENADO. At all times, we do not feel guilty, and we do not feel weighed down. #AnakngMasa in the Senate does a good job! So vote for 29 ESTRADA! Thanks to DZRH News Television for this wonderful interview! #ThennaEstrada # 29dotto #SatoratorJinggoyEstrada2019 Panuorin!  ANCHOR: Anong isusulong mo sa Senado sakaling mabigyan ka ng pagkakataon na bumalik ulit?  SEN. JINGGOY: Mabigyan ng MARANGAL NA TRABAHO ang ating mga kababayan dito sa ating bansa. Sa halip na magtrabaho sa ibang bansa sa Saudi sa Kuwait, alam mo mahirap mawalay ang isang padre de pamilya sa kanilang pamilya. Mas nanaisin ko na dito na lang sila magtrabaho sa ating bansa. Karamihan doon ay pinagsasamantalahan ng kanilang amo, binubugbog, minamaltrato, ginagahasa pa, yung ibang amo hindi pinapasweldo sa oras. ANCHOR: Anong SIKRETO ng pagiging MATAAS mo sa RATINGS?  SEN. JINGGOY: I attribute it dun sa performance natin sa loob ng 12 na taon. Marami naman tayong batas na naiakda, at marami rin tayong batas na naipasa at naging batas na. Naging active naman tayo sa mga deliberations sa Senado. PUSPUSAN naman tayong NAGTRABAHO sa SENADO. Kahit kailan, hindi tayo nagabsent, at hindi tayo nalate.  Good job po talaga ang #AnakngMasa sa Senado! Kaya vote para sa 29 na ESTRADA!

Sa 600 na panukalang batas na kanyang inilatag, marami dito ay tungkol sa pagpapaigting ng suporta ng gobyerno sa ating mga Bagong Bayani! Gaya ng bagong charter ng OWWA  (RA 10801), pagpapalakas ng National Labor Relations Commission (RA 9347) at ng Philippine Overseas Employment Administration or POEA (Republic Act 9422).  Libo libong mga OFW na minamaltrato at inaabuso sa ibang bansa ang nakauwi sa kanilang mga pamilya dahil kay Senator Jinggoy Estrada. At dahil din sa kanya, maraming buhay ang nasagip mula sa piitan at death rows.  Ibalik natin ang BOSES NG OFW sa SENADO! #29saBalota #SenatorJinggoyEstrada #AnakngMasa Ten of 16 candidates who have a \"statistical chance of winning\" in the May elections are from Hugpong, Pulse Asia said.  #AnakngMasa #29saBalota #SenatorJinggoyEstrada2019 #OverseasFilipinoworkers #Ofw https://news.abs-cbn.com/‚Ä¶/mar-slips-in-pulse-asia-survey-2‚Ä¶ Nag-enjoy ako sa pagikot sa Bankerohan Public Market, Davao.

Isa sa mga batas ni Senator Jinggoy Estrada ay ang SPES o Special Program for Employment of Students (SPES) kung saan binibigyan ng gobyerno ng insentibo ang mga businesses na tumanggap ng mga estudyante bilang empleyado kapag bakasyon gaya ng pasko o kapag summer vacation. Layunin ng batas na ito na bigyan ng skills at experience ang mga estudyante para maging handa sila sa hinaharap. Gayundin, inaasahan na makakatulong ang kinikita nila sa kanilang mga gastusin sa eskwela.

Sa tulong ni Senator Jinggoy Estrada, maraming OFW ang napauwi at nailigtas sa anumang kalupitan na naranasan nila sa ibang bansa.

But there was nothing hotter in the story and litter in the Talavera Town Market lately. Many thanks to all! Thank you to the Guimba Public Market colleagues earlier - even with the warm weather, smiles and stories still greeted me. Thanks for sharing your stories. In challenging times, we have to go back and reflect on our core values ‚Äã‚Äã- God-fearing, caring for others, helping and participating. I‚Äôm grateful to the Good Shepherd community for inviting me to share ideas on our economic freedom. The support and respect of the people I care about are important to me. So I make my service clean, well served. The public market gives a glimpse of the true state of our economy. Amid challenging times, resiliency and hope that things would get better are never lost on people in the marketplace. Those aspirations highlighted my visit to Carbon Public Market in Cebu City as I was treated to the Cebuano brand of warm welcome. Daghang salamat mga kasibanwa! Did you know that we have the Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG)? We promote this improved version of the Seal of Good Housekeeping by my friend and former DILG secretary Jesse Robredo to recognize and incentivize good local governments. In the improved version, we have expanded the criteria: In addition to proper spending, we have added business friendliness, disaster preparedness, peace and order, and social services to LGUs in the country. It is not our intention that every city and municipality in the country do well in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãgovernance. When we get back to the senate, we will try to give more LGUs an incentive from the Performance Challenge Fund allocation we set up. I met Rodel, a tricycle driver, who was accompanying his wife to shopping at the Sauyo-Bagbag market. She told the story that she only took the support of her husband and two children. But as fuel prices continue to rise, he finds it difficult to justify his daily income. For every liter of fuel that Rodel uses every day, P10 goes to the excise tax. If he uses five liters of fuel per day, that's P50. Enough for a pound of good rice. The first thing we can do for that is to eliminate the excise tax on petrol under Train Law. Noong DILG Secretary ako, siniguro nating lahat ng lalawigan sa bansa ay may maayos na kagamitan sa oras ng sakuna. Kasama diyan ang pagbibigay ng Rosenbauer firetrucks sa ating mga bumbero. Hindi tayo namili - kapartido man o hindi ang LGU, binigyan natin sila ng kagamitan upang maging mas mabilis, moderno, at epektibo ang kanilang pagtugon sa sunog. Another warm welcome with a sweet smile greeted me on my next visit to the Bogo Public Market in Cebu. Your continued support and support is truly heartening. Thank you so much! Another warm welcome with sweet smiles welcomed me again to my visit to the Bogo Public Market in Cebu. Your continuous patronage and support really warms my heart. Thank you very much! Today, we commemorate the bravery of Filipinos during the World War II. Not just the troops but also the ordinary people who lived in that era. Let this day be a reminder that we have the courage and heart to fight for our families, our fellowmen, and our beloved country. Binansagan tayo bilang 'Ama ng Call Centers' sa bansa dahil sa panunungkulan natin dati sa DTI nasimulan ang pang-eengganyo ng mga BPOs na pumasok sa Pilipinas. Mahigit isang milyon ng mga Pilipino ang nabigyan nang oportunidad na makapagtrabaho sa mga call centers at BPOs simula noon. Dahil sa dekalidad na mga trabaho na may maayos na sweldo, nakatikim na rin ng konting kaginhawaan sa buhay ang kani-kanilang mga pamilya. Marami ng mga Pilipino ang nakinabang sa BPOs at call centers. Marami pa ang puwedeng magawa natin para madagdagan ang bilang ng mga gumiginhawang mga pamilyang Pilipino.We have been destroyed as the 'Father of Call Centers' in the country because of our tenure before in DTI, the BPOs who entered the Philippines started engaging. More than a million of Filipinos have been given the opportunity to work in call centers and BPOS since then. Due to quality jobs with good compensation, their families have also tasted a bit of comfort in life. Many Filipinos have benefited from BPOS and call centers. There's more we can do to increase the number of prospered Filipino families. Celebration doubles at graduation: First, a graduation celebration of a child after a few years of hard work. Second, it is also a celebration of all those who support his studies. For the most part, it is the parents who sacrifice and make sacrifices so that their child can have a tuition and a nap. Congratulations to all graduates and their parents! Many ask: \"What jobs will graduates meet?\" When I was at DTI, my response was to invite call centers to bring their company to the Philippines. For new graduates, we will expand it once we get back to the senate. It was during my service as DOTC secretary when air navigation equipment were upgraded and infrastructure facilities in several airports in the country were improved. The renovation of all terminals of NAIA also happened during that time along with the completion of the Laguindingan Airport in Misamis Oriental for Cagayan de Oro-bound passengers. In order to accomplish these massive airport projects, we ensured that budget was allocated and put to good use. We hope to continue this kind of program where more infrastructure is available for the benefit and comfort of our fellow citizens. Thanks to the warm reception of the young ones and young once of Sariaya, Quezon! Congrats again on the 26th Anniversary of the Sariaya Senior Citizens Federation Inc. It is not obvious that there is a 20% discount on energy levels. Love you all! With the high cost of living and daily necessities, it is inevitable that money will be scarce. We are very grateful to RA 9504 as it has been a means of eliminating the tax on minimum wage earners. Instead of reducing the salaried family income, it added. Yes, I am at PEACE because I'm doing this for our country. I am confident that the Philippines, the Philippines, will be even further. Yes, I am at PEACE because I'm doing this for our country. I trust that the Philippines, the Filipino will go further. Sino ba ang apektado ng kakulangan sa trabaho, kulang na sweldo, at mataas na presyo ng bilihin? Kayo mismo. Dahil dito, aayusin natin ang mga ito para sa inyo.Who is affected by lack of work, lack of salaries, and high price of buy? You yourself. Because of this, we'll fix these for you. Dr. Jose Rizal, youth is the hope of the people. I believe in it, so I salute the teachers who wholeheartedly serve the town for the future. I met Cora who was 18 years old but was still struggling to make a living. She shared how tough it is being a daycare teacher, there are times they double as nannies to young kids. This is why I intend to take good care of the teachers as well. In addition to convenient salaries, provide teachers with great Health Benefits instead of spending on salaries, extra savings. Bakit biglang nagsisitaasan ang presyo ng mga bilihin? Ito ang sagot diyan, tumaas din kasi ang buwis na ipinataw sa produkto ng petrolyo. Kaya nagmahal ang mga bilihin, kasi nagmahal din ang presyo ng gasolina. Tanggalin natin ang buwis sa petrolyo at ilipat sa sin tax. Ang daming bayarin at ang taas ng mga bilihin. May trabaho ka nga pero kulang naman ang sahod. Bawat problemang ito ay nauuwi sa usaping pera. Paano mo ba mapapalago at magagamit ang iyong pera sa tamang paraan? It is for you personally and for the development of our economy that I am running for senate again. Dahil simula na ng pangangampanya, importante na mas maging alerto tayo sa ating paligid. I encourage everyone to respect the Comelec rules on proper postering. Taos-puso ang aking pagpapasalamat at pagpapahalaga sa laging mainit na pagtanggap at suporta ng mga Bicolano't Bicolana para maipagpatuloy ang tunay na paglilingkod at serbisyong Ekonomismo sa ating Bayan. Dios mabalos! ‚ù§Ô∏èMy thanks and appreciation for always warm welcome and support of Bicolana's Bicolana to continue the true service and Economism service to our Nation. God, mabalos! ‚ù§Ô∏è Here in Naga, with the entire Otso Direct and our Vice President Leni Robredo. Our mission is our fight for the well-being and development of our country, for every Filipino. Ako ay nagbibigay pugay at humihiling ng gabay at patnubay sa aking kaibigang si former DILG Sec. Jesse Robredo na patuloy na nagsisilbing inspiration on genuine public service and clean governance. First day of the campaign with my friends in Capiz. From the beginning, you were there for me. Thank you so much for your continued encouragement. Ngayong simula ng kampanya, nagbabalik ako kung saan nagsimula ang lahat. Looking back, we met so many people. We listened to their stories ‚Äì their ups and downs. Sa kanila ako humugot ng lakas to continue fighting. Despite all the less-than-expected results, I believe I can still help our people through my experience and knowledge. Gusto kong makatulong na mas malayo pa ang marating ng mga Pilipino. To help her husband, Jennilyn sells at the Camarin market. Her husband has a job but is not regular and is not earning enough. To make the income of Jennilyn's wife profitable, we will add incentives to eco-zones in the country to enable more factories and companies to invest in them. I am sure this will result in more jobs for Filipinos. Always good to be back in Bulacan. Still smiling and warm welcome, thank you very much! Always good to be back in Bulacan. Smiles and warm welcome still ready, thank you so much! Ordinary Filipinos face daily challenges in life. Struggling with often insufficient income to support the family. Their burden increases with each increase in the price of basic commodities. The government should not impose additional burdens on them due to the excise tax on petroleum under the Train Law. We need to correct this situation. From the beginning, I believe that pre-need plan holders need protection and assurance to have a good return on investment. I have tried and suggested several laws in the past that have almost always come to nothing. But I didn't give up, so now we have Republic Act No. 9829 or the Pre-Need Code of the Philippines aimed at ensuring the stability and growth of the pre-need industry in the country. As a result, the Filipino people who are taking pre-need plans are more specific and content. Every penny they spend on companies for the future of themselves and their families is well guarded. Owning your own business is a key to accelerating family life. That's why I pushed for MSME development through the SULONG o SMEs Unified Lending Opportunities for National Growth program. It provided P26.7 billion low-interest loans for 281,229 SMEs in the country during its first year of implementation. On my next visit to Jesse's grave, I again met Manang Margie, the caretaker there. I admire her because she supports her family by being a caretaker at the cemetery, receiving laundry, and 4Ps from the government. 4Ps should be promoted because I believe it will be an investment in the future of ordinary Filipino families. I admire him because he promotes his family by being a caretaker in the cemetery, receiving laundry, and 4 Ps from the government. The enactment of 4 Ps should be promoted because I believe this is an investment in the future of ordinary Filipino families. We have already started providing incentives to multinational companies to encourage them to set up their headquarters here in the country. But now, there are those who want to get rid of these incentives. In my opinion, the removal of incentives to foreign companies that have built or can set up their factories here in the Philippines should be considered because it could cause unemployment for many Filipinos. Concerns are doubled when a family member becomes ill. You are thinking about your loved one, you are thinking about medical bills. So for me, it's time to expand on what we passed in Cheaper Medicines Law. Let's add new and more effective drugs to reduce consumer anxiety. Ang ganda ng weather because Spring‚Äôs almost here kaya we took a walk with the kids at the park. Happy weekend! Investment is especially important for those who want to do business. Not all savings are available as an investment. What's the solution? Cheap loan. How sweet it is! I told Paolo that he could not get married until P & P.How sweet college is! I told Paolo, he can't get married until P&P graduates from college. Tina Ladisla is a regular buyer at the Kiko Camarin Area D Wet and Dry Market in Caloocan. Here he buys fish he sells in his own place at another market. We need to make the transportation of products to markets easier and more coordinated. This way, we can better balance the prices in different markets. \"What are your plans for growing our economy?\" This is the question Karen, a youth leader in Laguna, asked me. My answer is simple: More work especially for young people. For when they finish school, they will have no difficulty finding a job. Once they get paid, the money they spend on restaurants, hotels, airlines, department stores, and more will spin into our economy. When I was a congressman, I enacted legislation to make it more reasonable to fund classrooms. In the past, funding for this was under way. If LGU officials are not strong enough to sit, students in their municipalities are poor. Today, this law is called Roxas Law. When I passed it, I saw the ability of a lawmaker to help many Filipinos. It inspired me to continue my career in public service. Reunited feels sooo good! I had to pause in the campaign to pick up my brother. Bonus and here is also Paolo. Reunited feels sooo good! I used the campaign to pick up my mother and daughter. Bonus, Paolo is also here. I met Mom Marites when I visited Mabalacat. As a single mom, all she ever wanted for her children was to finish school and find a good job. She told that three of her seven children were already employed by IT companies in Clark. I was thrilled that it was a concrete result of the growth we made in the IT-BPO industry when I was DTI Secretary. I hope to grow the IT-BPO and other industries to open up more opportunities to Filipinos. Aris Villanueva, an employee of a construction company from Mabalacat, Pampanga. He expressed his gratitude to me in raising the tax exemption on minimum wage earners. He said, after the law was signed, his employer decided to give him a tax refund and return the withholding taxes deducted from his salary in his early years with the company. Although not that big, it helped buy the milk of her newborn baby. Ari Villanueva, an employee of the construction company from Mabalacat, Pampanga. He sent thanks to me for advancing tax exemption to minimum wage earners. He said, after signing the law, his employer decided to give him a tax refund and return the withholding tax deducted from his salary for his first years in the company. Even though it's not big, it said it helped buy milk from his forehead, they are newly born. Do you have travel goals? Doesn't it havesle if there are overbooking, canceled and delayed flights, misleading advertisements on fares and lost luggage to airlines? When I was at DOTC, I co-authored the Air Passenger Bill of Rights. It requires airlines to compensate passengers in the event of a hassle mentioned. Once we get back to the Senate, I will expand it so that our airports will not be lost. I believe that the making of laws and policies should be based on the experience of Filipinos. In this series, we will talk about what our countrymen told me, and the possible solutions to their grievances. It is natural for Filipinos to be happy in the midst of trouble. Although another increase in fuel prices has been lifted, tricycle drivers in the Angeles City public market are still joking about it. They will be truly and completely happy if the excise tax on petroleum is removed under Train Law. This will be my first focus if I am given the opportunity to serve again. The price of fish at Guagua Public Market is low. It has been breached by the latter from neighboring fisheries, including the Guagua River. Depending on the size, the price of tilapia is around P40 to P50. It's cheaper if you buy more. This is the story of Alex Alarcon, one of the fish dealers I spoke with. Fish price is cheap at Guagua Public Market. Because it fell late from the neighboring fishpond, including the Guagua River. Depending on the size, tilapia price is in P40 to P50 per kilo. This would be cheaper if buying is wholesale. This is the story of Alex Alarcon, one of the fish dealers I talked to. Thank you to everyone na naki-selfie at groufie sa pagbisita ko sa Angeles City Public Market! Sharing with you some of our photos from that morning visit. These are still a few pictures of my visit to Dumaguete. Kapag tag ulan sobra-sobra ang tubig, kapag tagtuyot, walang tubig. Whether it‚Äôs a big or a small dam or a small water impounding, ipunin natin ang sobra sobrang tubig para hindi tayo magkulang sa panahon ng tagtuyot, sa panahon ng pangangailangan. As I rounded up the Camarin market in Caloocan, sellers told me they were happier and more shopping when prices were low. We can help here if we eliminate excise tax on petroleum as it has a huge impact on the transport cost of goods. Retailers are more likely to buy, and buyers will earn more. \"Mar Mar,\" is what the couple Joseph and Faye would like to call me in a joint sale of meat in the Angeles market. It was after they asked me if I could be the godfather of their third child that Faye was currently pregnant with. My response: \"I can.\" It was a warm day when I received a welcome from my Ilonggo compatriots at the Iloilo Super Public Terminal Market. Many thanks to all of you! Affordable drug prices are important especially for grandparents who buy their maintenance medicines. For example, Diamicron's 30 tablets for Diabetes are worth P877.50 and due to their 20% senior citizen discount, it would be just P702. But as it turns out, their drug discount is only 8% because of the 12% VAT. To make the most of their discount, I introduced the Expanded Senior Citizens Act. Under this law, they are exempted from paying VAT on drugs and other services to reduce their costs. We have introduced the Republic Act 9505 or Personal Equity and Retirement Account (PERA) Law which aims to help workers save for their retirement and retirement. The law also includes raising interest rates on workers' savings. In addition to providing affiliated tax incentives. When you have big savings, there is enough investment to start your own business and not have to be an employee. At the Super Public Terminal Market in Iloilo City we greet the sellers and the merchants. Many of them are complaining of poor affection. I am happy that I have joined them as I push and keep prices down in the markets. Whether your purchase is in retail or in the public market, any fraud in the prices and weight of the merchandise is incorrect. As DTI Secretary then, we implemented the People's Weights program to provide protection to consumers in the market. I met Mang Juanito who, besides being a pastor, is also president of the local TODA in Barangay In Descendants, Antipolo. As a tricycle driver, he said it was difficult for them to increase fuel prices. It reduces the money they give home. As a result, they are forced to raise fares that their passengers do not like. This is one of the reasons why we are advancing the elimination of excise tax on petroleum products. If the government needs funding, then other products can only be taxed instead of transportation related products and major commodities in the market. We enjoy the warm reception of the Burgos public market in Bacolod. This is proof of their continued push for lower prices of the market. I am not in favor of the excise tax on petroleum now covered by Train Law. We know that when gasoline prices rise, the prices of other commodities will follow. Para sa mga manggagawang Pilipino na patuloy na nagtatrabaho at nagbibigay ng tapat na serbisyo, karapat-dapat lamang na bigyan sila ng sapat at maayos na suweldo. Sa pagsasabatas ng income tax exemption para sa mga minimum wage earners na isinulong natin noon, nagkaroon ng mas malaking take-home pay ang mga ordinaryong manggagawa upang matustusan ang kanilang pang-araw-araw na gastusin. Wilma's mother was one of the senior citizens I met in Capiz. He noted that he was receiving P1,500 from the government every three months, but that was not enough to buy his maintenance medicines. When we return to the senate, we will advance the broader coverage of what we previously passed Cheaper Medicines Law. It will greatly help Mom Wilma and many other senior citizens who buy medicine. Sa pag-iikot ko sa Dumaguete City Public Market, Tanjay Market, Mabinay Market, Kabankalan Market, at Bago Market sa mga probinsya ng Negros Oriental at Negros Occidental, nakakuwentuhan ko ang ilang tindera at tindero.  Sinabi nilang apektado rin ang kanilang benta tuwing nagtataas ang presyo ng gasolina dahil nagmamahal ang kanilang tinda. Para sa akin, kailangan nating bantayan nang maigi ang pagtaas ng mga presyo dahil ang maliliit na negosyante at mga ordinaryong Pilipino ang higit na nagigipit dahil dito. It is a tribute to our Aunt, Mom, Aunt and Grandmother and to all the women who continue to be the light of our lives. Happy Women's Month! The internet is no longer just for social media and streaming. It is also a tool of over one million Filipinos in the search for a living. Examples include online English teachers, writers, editors, and translators. More opportunities will benefit from new internet services in the Philippines. I will propose that telcos franchises will be a requirement for investing in infrastructure that will improve internet service in our country, and paying more attention to areas of low coverage. I will also be pushing the more straightforward advertising of internet speed related services, to make it clear to consumers exactly what they are getting at what they pay for. The problem of rising prices of basic commodities is further complicating the growing number of unemployed Filipinos. Filipino workers should be given priority. We have many excellent carpenters, masons, and welder. Only Filipinos should benefit from jobs here in the Philippines. During my visit to Brgy. Illustrated, Antipolo, our people have given me the hardships they face in the search for employment and income. When I was at DTI, we pushed for growth in the call center industry, which now employs over one million Filipinos. But did you know that out of every one hundred call center agent applicants, only five receive? So besides opening up opportunities, it is also important to provide training to applicants to make sure they get the job. Due to the continued price movement of basic commodities, many Filipino families have difficulty budgeting their incomes. I still remember when I was at DTI, we watched the price of canned sardines to remain P8.25 to P8.50. When I visit the markets today, I see that it is at P13.25 to P17.60. There is something the government can do to prevent such price increases. Citizens' money is used for government projects and programs. I encourage everyone especially the youth to have a thorough and informed review of where our taxes go. Corruption can be avoided if citizens are actively engaged in their government. Tricycle drivers like Mang Nadong in Capiz earn very little. He will be especially concerned if prices of petroleum products increase. For Mang Nadong and the other drivers, we will push for the excise tax on petroleum products. It can help to increase the money they can bring home. Mahalaga sa mga senior citizen ang access sa murang gamot para sa maintenance. Natutuwa ako na malaki ang naitutulong ng naipasa nating Cheaper Medicines Law sa mga tulad ni Nanay Wilma ng Brgy. Milibili sa Roxas City.  Para sa akin, panahon na para dagdagan ang gamot at teknolohiya na kasama sa coverage ng Cheaper Medicines Law. Maganda rin kung maeengganyo natin ang iba pang foreign pharmaceutical companies na gumagawa ng mabisa at murang gamot na magbenta ng kanilang produkto dito sa Pilipinas. Jessica is a dedicated barangay health worker (BHW) in Brgy. Punta Tabok, Roxas City. In exchange for his services, he receives a salary of P500 every three months. My mother had just been getting enough of this amount. We should only help others. One of the ways I see it is that we have advanced Bottom-Up Budgeting. In this system, citizens choose their finances using government money. Extra allowances and equipment for BHWs can be selected, rather than the traditional arches or unused waiting shed built by politicians.Mother Jessica is a dedicated barangay health worker (BHW) in Brgy. Going to Tabok, Roxas City. In exchange for his service, he receives P500 salary every three months. Mom's fare is missing this amount. We deserve to help those who help others. One of the ways I see was promoted before Bottom-Up Budgeting. In this system, people choose what they will fund with government money. You can choose extra allowance and equipment for BHWs, instead of the used arch or unused waiting shed built by politicians. Si Joseph, isang jeepney driver mula sa Pasay. Pumapasada para masuportahan ang kanyang pamilya. Pero dahil sa taas ng presyo ng gasolina, kaunti lang ang naiuuwi niyang kita. Tanggalin natin ang excise tax sa gasolina para makatulong sa iba pang kagaya ni Joseph. How can Filipinos prosper if prices of basic necessities, such as gasoline, continue to rise? I propose to ease your burden by not just suspending but repealing the tax on gasoline. How do we solve our problem on mining? Proper enforcement of mining-related laws and ensuring that mining companies have adequate capital for environmental protection. Let's grow our own. Help farmers maintain good quality and efficient rice production to increase supply and lower prices. I do not feel that our political rival has made it this far because of the warm welcome of the Mabalacat people on my next visit. Thank you very much! Why do I want to cut taxes? Why am I in favor of speeding up the internet? Why would I want to enact 4Ps? Because for you personally. Our grandparents spend many years of hard work to support their families and help the country's economy. With that, the government should consider raising the amount of social pension for senior citizens. Let's not make them feel as though they are waiting for the afternoon spot of life. A must, life support. We have the diligence, we have the skill, we have the talent and the talent. Why is it so difficult to come up, why is it so difficult to live in the Philippines? The government should be our ally. I'll be your own ally in the Senate. We should celebrate unity in celebrating the anniversary of EDSA People Power. Ka Felix recounted the sad fact of being a senior and unemployed. It is inevitable that the family will make them feel as though they are overburdened because nothing contributes to their daily expenses. Looking into the issue of domestic violence against senior citizens, it is high time to create jobs for the seniors who are still able and knowledgeable. Let's give them a suitable facility because our beloved grandparents can still be productive in their own way. Ni√±a's message is gratefully acknowledged as one of the 4000 members of the 4Ps program in Barangay In Descendants. 4.5M families have been granted and benefited from 4Ps. There are many, and many more. That is why I will continue to strengthen the 4Ps program for all the children to have continued financial support to fill their stomach and sharpen their mind so eventually they will gain enough capability to get better jobs. Welcome to Juvy‚Äôs Miscellaneous store. According to Juvy, their prices have almost doubled. Do you think so? The sardines are in the P20 range and the corned beef delicacy is around P34-40. It is good that the tax cuts for the minimum wage earners have been implemented. Because of that, instead of saving, they brought home more budget. This is just the beginning, so let's raise each other's life. After 15 years, many new discoveries and technologies have been discovered. That is why we need to catch up, revisit and widen the coverage of the Cheaper Medicine Law to add new medicines especially maintanance medicines on the list. Pharmaceutical companies should also be obliged to lower the prices of their drugs. Must be #PriceNoPressure to reduce altitude. After 15 years, a lot of new medicine and technology has been discovered. That is why we need to catch up, revisit and widen the coverage of the Cheaper Medicine Law to add new medicine especially maintanance medicines on the list. Pharmaceutical companies should also be compelled to lower the price of their medicines. Must be #Pressure to reduce blood pressure. Filipinos are known to be hardworking. Negosyante sa umaga, call center agent sa gabi. Kayo ang nag papa-unlad ng ekonomiya ng bansa, kaya buo ang suporta ko sa inyo. If I will be blessed and put into position to help, isusulong natin ang murang pautang para sa mga micro, small, and medium enterprises. Gamitin natin ng tama ang kakayanan ng gobyerno at ipasa ang savings sa mga Pilipinong nag nanais mag negosyo.Filipinos are known to be hardworking. Businessman in the morning, call center agent at night. You are the ones making the economy of the country, so my support for you is full. If I will be blessed and put into position to help, we will promote cheap loan for micro, small, and medium enterprises. Let's use the capacity of the government correctly and pass the savings to Filipinos who want to do business. In an interview with ANC Headstart, Karen asked what I think went wrong and what would I have changed to solve inflation.  I believe that it's not failure in economy but failure in policy. If there is a failure in the crop, then you have to be agile. Before we say we can't, let's give it our all. I enjoy my visit to the Dipolog public market. The reception of the Zamboangenos was very warm. Many thanks. My happiness in visiting Dipolog public market. The Zamboangenos welcome was very warm. Thank you very much. Bukod sa matumal aniya ang benta, isa pa sa hinaing ni Carol, nagtitinda ng karne sa Guagua public market ay ang kalumaan ng kanilang palengke na tila ba naghahangad ng kaayusan. Kung ipapatupad lang ng lokal na pamahalaan ang programang Bottom-Up Budgeting na aking itinatag noon sa DILG, nakakatiyak akong mabibigyan ng pondo para maisaayos o ma-renovate ang palengke ng Guagua. Dahil sa BUB, ang mamamayan ang nagdedesiyon kung saan dapat ginagamit ng LGU ang kanilang pondo para makinabang ang mas nakararami. Time well spent saying hello to our friends from Pagadian, Zamboanga del Sur. Thank you to everyone who met us! I was once asked about rice tarrification. To me, the rice tarrification was like going to the emergency room. There is a saying that 'an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.' We should be there for prevention rather than immediate cure. The cure means we will import rice from Thailand or Vietnam. We need to fix the farming in our country, make it more modern, focus and meet the needs of the farmers and give them cheap loans. In fact, in New City in Negros Occidental, some farmers used hybrid seeds to produce up to six to eight tonnes of rice yield per acre. Two or four tonnes of rice yield is usually obtained by farmers per hectare. I believe that Filipinos should still feed their fellow Filipinos and that will happen if we support our farmers. It is a great honor to be part of the Ahon Layal Coalition gathering at Plaza Independencia, Cebu City. Thank you for your warm welcome and your continued trust. For us, transparency and accountability in leadership are important. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of the Full Disclosure Policy. The program promotes both transparency and accountability in governance. It aims to prevent but immediately stop corruption among LGUs in publicizing the disbursements, income, bidding and other transactions entered into and existing by the local government even in the villages. Local or village projects and programs should be open to the public's knowledge. Through an open and transparent public bidding, we hope to generate interest among our local companies to take part in the government‚Äôs effort to provide a convenient, affordable, reliable, efficient and safe sea transport system. With people's support and good grace during our service as DOTC secretary, several sea ports projects in the country were completed. We hope to continue this kind of program where more infrastructure is available for the promotion of trade and tourism in the country. Tindera ng isda si Marilou Narciso, 46 anyos, sa palengke ng Mabinay, Negros Oriental. Ang kanyang asawa ay empleyado sa munisipyo ng Mabinay. Buong pagmamalaki niyang kinuwento na naging mahusay siyang katuwang ng kanyang asawa sa pagtataguyod ng kanilang pamilya dahil sa pagtitinda niya ng isda sa loob ng mahigit 20 taon na. Lima ang kanilang anak; ang panganay nila ay isa ng guro, ang sumunod naman ay graduating na sa college. Umaasa silang mag-asawa na mapapatapos rin nila ang tatlo pa nilang anak sa pag-aaral mula sa pamumuhunan nila ng sipag at tiyaga. Ayon kay Marilou, mahalaga na mayroong trabaho at paraan para kumita ang bawat miyembro ng pamilya dahil siguradong magdadala iyon ng kaginhawaan sa kanilang pamilya. Afternoon well-spent with our hardworking barangay health workers, the unsung heroes of our health care system. I committed my support for their SINTA agenda - security of tenure, institutionalization, nurturing, transformative development and adequacy. Kahit mainit, ang taas ng energy nila!

Once again the Flowers gave their warm and welcoming welcome during my visit to the Sta. Mary. Thank you for your continued trust and support! It was heartening that the staff at Ortega‚Äôs Best Frozen Foods welcomed us during our visit to Baliuag. Stop what they are doing so that their sweet smiles and happy greetings will greet us. Thanks a lot! In the middle of the warmer weather, Dad Dionisio was cool selling ice cream outside the Julian Pastor market in Batangas City. He even extended his family's full support to our campaign. Thank you very much! Under Republic Act 9576 or the PDIC Charter Amendment we propose, from 250k the maximum deposit coverage of each bank depositor has been increased to 500k. This enables the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDCI) to effectively fulfill its vital task of promoting and safeguarding the interests of the depositing public. We are therefore more confident that the salaries saved for the future will not be wasted. Nakausap ko si Marcelo, isa sa mga maraming porter sa loob ng Angeles City public market. Sila ang mga nagdadala ng mga pinamili ng kanilang mga suki mula sa mga puwesto ng paninda sa palengke hanggang sa sakayan o parking sa labas. Sa isang hatid ay kumikita siya ng P30 hanggang P40. Kailangan niyang magkaroon nang hindi bababa sa 15 customer para kumita siya ng P450 pataas kada araw. Mahirap na trabaho at walang kasiguruhan ang kita. Puwedeng i-organisa ang grupo nila Marcelo at maging isang maliit na negosyo upang maisaayos ang kanilang kita. Isa yan sa puwede nating maitulong sa mga gustong magsimula ng kanilang maliit na negosyo sa pamamagitan ng programa para sa murang pautang upang magamit bilang puhunan. In addition, the Barangay Health Workers (BHW) service should be appreciated in their respective constituents. They are the first to be run by the citizens when it comes to health issues but their position as well as their monthly honoraria is uncertain. Under the Bottom-Up Budgeting program that we implemented at DILG, the LGUs provided adequate funding including adequate appropriation for BHWs and their invaluable service to those in need in each village. I met my fiance Mar as she was shopping in the Sauyo-Bagbag market. He said it was his birthday that day and he had a little dinner with them. I congratulated him on 'Happy Birthday!' In our story, I was overjoyed to find out that Mar was one of our helpers when we passed the tax exemption for minimum wage earners. He was an employee of the frozen food company and the tax exemption helped him increase his take-home pay home to the family every week and the end of the month. I met Rommel and his wife Fe in the Angeles City public market. They have a place to refinish and in the presence of Fe sell plastic wares. Rommel told me that they also sell imported rice that is supposed to be bought because besides being cheaper, it is still cheap. It is sad to think of this situation but Filipinos should feed our fellow Filipinos especially when it comes to our staple food. Our farmers and local rice wholesalers will benefit more if they buy rice instead of import. The solution is this: Give our farmers financial support to have modern farming equipment and facilities to increase their yield. Always good to be back in Sorsogon. Bicolans are still smiling and warm, thank you very much! Time well spent saying hello to our friends from Masbate. Thank you so much for all your welcome and stories! A warm welcome filled with almost unbroken smiles and joys from the Cebuans during our visit to the Argao public market is heartbreaking. Thanks so much! We are fighting RA 8756 or the Regional Headquarters Law which has been the key to expanding the BPO Industry in our country. This law encourages multinational corporations to invest in the Philippines by giving them incentives to create more jobs for the Filipinos. Yehey! Waffles with spaghetti sauce or waffle bolognese or bread and grilled. By whatever name it's called, it's delicious. Try it. Long live, Pancake House! P. S. Grilled cheese and spaghetti sauce is also a wow Tina's energy is amazing! Even though he wakes up early to sell in the market, he smiles and greets us. He added: \"My OFW wife is an idol and she is about to retire and come home to help me in our small catering business in Molo.\" Certainly additional income for the family when doing business. If our OFWs, like Tina's wife, have sufficient savings, it is best to do business without being separated from the family. We have already done that with the SULONG or SME Unified Lending Opportunities for National Growth program to provide government financial institutions with sufficient funding to want small businesses in the country. The implementation of this beautiful program is essential. My heartfelt condolences to the family and relatives of those killed and injured in the Suello Village in Baguio. This is a very sad event. Julia, Adelina, Elizabeth, Richelda, Josephine, and John Roy: many thanks for your help, and may your souls cry out. To the injured volunteers: thank you very much. I will include in my prayer your speedy recovery. You can count on our continued efforts to achieve our goals for our families and our nation. In the past, we have seen the great potential of the development of the BPO industry in the Philippines, thus promoting the revision of RA 7916 or the \"Special Economic Zone Act of 1995\" making BPO industries exempt from paying national and local taxes, and only had to contribute 5% of their gross income as tax. This attracts more foreign investors. Thus, created more jobs for the Filipinos. I asked Vhirnia, a vegetable seller in the Batangas City old public market, why the price of a kilo of tomatoes he sells is P30 and it is only P15 per kilogram in Bulacan. He replied: \"Of course, that includes trucking.\" Vhirnia is right, the price of her goods will certainly increase if transport costs are included. This will be further affected by rising fuel prices as a result of the excise tax on petroleum. We don't have to torment our little ones if we have the right taxes and the right taxes. It will be our priority to repeal the excise tax on petroleum if we are given the opportunity to serve in the Senate again. When we visited the Angeles City Public Market in Pampanga, this was our observation: For three months the prices of some basic commodities such as salt (P10 / kg) and sardines (P18 / can) remained the same. The price of rice, however, currently plays at P38-40 per kilogram. It went down according to the sellers. Meanwhile, the price of evaporated milk rose from P24 to P26. The price of the goods is so high that a Price Watch program is important. We started it when I was in DTI. We focus on the prices of basic commodities from its unjust rise to safeguard consumer welfare. Meet Belinda, like many Filipinos, she sometimes made her way overseas as an OFW. However, his experience was complicated. It used to be like death row in Abu Dhabi. But in God's mercy, we helped him get out of the country and into the Philippines. So, I'm so glad to see her again and Belinda's sweet thanks to us. I do not recognize that of all the lines we play, Baliuag is one of our most influential. Despite the warm weather, we were greeted with greetings and stories from construction workers during our visit to Maasin, Southern Leyte. I salute your hard work and dedication! Always be prepared and stay safe my fellow Filipinos. Having been selling vegetables for over 30 years, Elsa's mother has been able to help her husband and wife work in the government to get their five children to school. They are all professionals. This is our goal for Filipinos - that if you work hard and persevere, you will find comfort in the future. And this will happen under a vibrant economy in our country, so this is where we will focus on the opportunity to serve again. Nakausap ko si Bong nang papalabas na ako ng palengke ng Tandang Sora. Tindero siya ng mga gulay na pangsangkap na nasa plastic kagaya ng kamatis, sibuyas, bawang, at iba pa. Tinanong ko siya kung nasa tamang timbang ba ang bawat paninda niya at walang kagatol-gatol siyang sumagot ng ‚Äòopo.‚Äô Kumuha ako ng isang plastic ng sibuyas na kanyang tinitinda at inilagay sa Timbangan ng Bayan na malapit sa puwesto ni Bong. Nasa wastong timbang nga ang kanyang paninda. Iyan ang kahalagahan ng pagkakaroon ng Timbangan ng Bayan sa lahat ng palengke sa bansa na ating ipinatupad upang mabantayan ang presyo ng mga bilihin sa palengke. Wala ring mamimili na madadaya sa timbang.I talked to Bong when I was out of Rooster Sora market. He is a salesman of vegetable ingredients in plastic like tomatoes, onions, garlic, etc. I asked her if every stock was at the right weight and she didn't answer ' yes. ' I took a plastic onions he sells and put it in the Town Timbangan near Bong's place. His stock is in proper weight. That's the importance of having a Town Scale in all markets in the country we implemented to guard the price of market groceries. No buyer is mocked by weight either. Maupay nga aga! It‚Äôs good to be back in Tacloban Public Market where I was met with warm smiles, hugs, and greetings from the ever resilient Leyte√±os. Kahit papano magandang makita na tuloy-tuloy ang recovery at progreso ng Leyte. Tindero ng isda sa palengke ng Tandang Sora si Vicente. Sa biglang pagtaas ng presyo ng gasolina, wala silang magawa kundi ipasa sa kanilang mamimili ang dagdag sa presyo ng ilan sa kanilang paninda. Hindi lang si Vicente at mga nagtitinda sa mga palengke ang matutulungan natin kung matatanggal natin ang excise tax sa petrolyo sa ilalim ng Train Law. Kasama na diyan ang mas nakakaraming mga mamimili na karaniwang pilit pinagkakasya ang kanilang budget araw-araw. Noong tayo ay nasa kongreso pa lang pangarap na natin na magkaroon ng masiglang kalakalan sa ating bansa at maging globaly competitive tayo. That's why we authored a bill which aims to provides the legal framework to allow our capital market to keep pace with fast changing domestic & international developments.  Kilala na ito ngayon as RA 8799 - Securities Regulation Code. It encourage wide public ownership of business enterprises and enhance the democratization of wealth. Moreover, it strengthen anti-fraud division, self-regulation, and SEC rule-making process. Nakilala namin si Barangay Kagawad Thelma sa Burgos public market sa Bacolod. Nagtitinda siya ng gulay at upang madagdagan ang paninda niya at kita, nangungutang siya sa Turko ng 5-6. Sa katotohanan, halos napupunta lang ang dagdag kita ni Thelma sa mataas na interes na kanyang binabayaran sa utang. Kailangan talagang bigyan ng ayuda ng pamahalaan ang mga kagaya ni Thelma na pilit nagsusumikap para mabigyan ng maginhawang buhay ang kanilang pamilya. Isa sa mga pangunahing isusulong natin ay ang pagkakaroon ng programa para murang pautang ang gobyerno upang maraming matulungan na maliliit na negosyanteng mga Pilipino. A warm welcome and sweet smile greeted me by the Samarnons during my visit to the Catarman Public Market in Northern Samar. Thank you so much for your continued support! After the Santa Week where we had the opportunity to bond with our family and reflect on the continuity of our fight. Hi all, happy Easter! Back in Dagupan, known as the Bangus Capital of the Philippines! Thank you ulit sa pagsalubong ninyo! The internet is part of the daily lives of Filipinos in the challenges of life. Like electricity, water and other utilities, the internet is one of necessity. Aside from BPOs and call centers, over one million Filipinos with expertise in writing, language translation, video and graphics editing, and many other specialized skills, are now relying on the internet to make a living. The internet is already contributing to our economy so it is only right that telco players in the country should speed it up. We must not be satisfied with being No. 88 worldwide when it comes to internet speed so that many Filipino families can continue to make life easier for them to use it in their daily living. The province of Tarlac has a model program for Barangay Health Workers (BHW) that we hope to implement for the entire country. The recognition of NPAs as Heroes to the End is truly wonderful. Long live you all! We were met with a very welcoming and appreciative crowd during our visit at San Pedro public market in Laguna. We actually filled up a key alleyway! Thank you for the continued support and trust! Berna, a shrimp seller in the Batangas City market, told me that they were about to move out of the huge Julian Pastor super market. That's one of the effects of the so-called Bottom-Up Budgeting that we developed when we were at DILG. In fact, some 37,760 projects were funded by the BUB and 1,516 cities and municipalities were deferred for the development of their Local Poverty Reduction Plans (LPRAPs). Local governments and their constituents know better than the national government where the budget should be used so that more people can benefit from it. Good to be here in Orani public market, where seafoods are always fresh, and smiles are plentiful. Thank you for such a warm welcome! Hindi matatawaran ang sayang dulot na makakita ng kagaya ni Nanay Julieta, tindera ng karneng baboy at chicharon sa Victory Uptown Market sa Tarlac City. Siya mismo ang nangangampanya sa mga nagdadaan at mga mamimili niya na iboto ang inyong lingkod sa pagka-Senador. Binigyan pa niya ako ng isang plastic ng chicharon nang kami ay magkadaupang palad. Maraming salamat Nanay Julieta! Sa suporta mo at ng marami pang iba kumukuha ng lakas ang kampanya nating ito. #ItsAWow the Balanga market! Very clean, clean, and orderly. I can see why people enjoy it here. In the past, due to the collapse of the peso against the dollar, the price of flour in the local market has severely affected. When I served as DTI secretary, we launched the Pinoy Pandesal Program. Provides funding for SMEs - businesses with less than P1 million in capital. They were in bad debt so they gradually grew their businesses. This helped keep the price of the peso in the past. We hope to have a broader program to make the government more affordable and help more small businesses in the country. It has always been our dream to provide quality and permanent employment to Filipinos. In fact, during our stint as DTI secretary, we convinced Microsoft founder Bill Gates to donate to us 20,000 authentic Microsoft software. In this country, we have implemented the Personal Computers for Public Schools (PCPS) Program where we distribute over 10,000 computers with the authentic Microsoft software to 2,000 public high schools in the country. Due to PCPS, the number of computer-skilled high school students has increased, many of whom are crossing over to work at BPOs and call centers. Nakilala namin si Cherald Joy sa Sauyo-Bagbag market. Siya ay call center agent at ang asawa niya naman ay graphic artist. Maayos ang kinikita nilang mag-asawa at tama lang para mabigyan ng kumportableng buhay ang dalawang nilang anak. Ang mga magandang klaseng trabaho tulad sa mag-asawang ito ay ilan lang sa milyong mga oportunidad na nabigyan-daan sa pagpasok ng mga call centers at BPOs sa ating bansa na dinala natin noong nasa DTI tayo. Marami na tayong nagawa sa industriyang ito at marami pa tayong puwedeng magawa kung mabibigyan muli ng pagkakataong makabalik sa serbisyo. There are definitely parents who relate to the story of May, a salesman in the Iloilo market. Her previous experience with getting an education plan was not good. When the pre-need company closed down, he lost his investments here and broke the education plan of his two children. In enacting the Pre-Need Code of 2008 (Republic Act No. 9829) that we have advanced, the Insurance Commission ensures that every company that offers pre-need plans has sufficient funds. So, now, we are more certain and satisfied that every Filipino has a penny to the pre-need companies in the country. Noong Senador ako, naghain ako ng panukalang magbibigay ng dignidad at nararapat na pagpapahalaga sa mga Barangay Health Workers. Hangad ko na tuluyan na itong maging batas para may mapanghahawakan ang mga frontliners sa ating mga Barangay. Salamat sa mga BHW ng Tarlac! Kayo ang nagbibigay ng inspirasyon sa pagtataguyod ng layuning ito.When I was a Senator, I sacrificed a bill that would give dignity and worthy appreciation to Barangay Health Workers. I wish this would be completely a law for frontliners to hold something in our Barangays. Thanks to the BHWs of Tarlac! You inspire me to promote this goal. You know a warm welcome when you see the smiles of the lady vendors of Bi√±an public market. Thank you Tarlac for the tireless support! Fight the heat of the warm welcome! Whenever we visit markets in different parts of the country, there is always a warm welcome from our fellow senior citizens. They are also equally grateful - Cheaper Medicines Law was enacted when I was a Senator. They say the law helps them to buy their own maintenance medicines. If the mandate is renewed, we will expand the coverage of Cheaper Medicines Law to include more drugs not just for senior citizens, but for everyone else. For what is our fight to create more jobs such as call centers, lower commodity prices as we lower the cost of senior citizen maintenance medicines, and adjust Filipinos' income and salaries such as removal let's tax the minimum wage earners tax? For us personally.What is our fight to create more jobs like call centers, lower the price of groceries as we lower the price of senior citizens maintenance medicines, and repairing the income and salaries of Filipinos like removal Let's tax the minimum wage earners ? For all of you. It was a coincidence that our birthday was still the same, so he extended his greeting with a birthday song. I also gave her a warm welcome! Thanks for your birthday.Our birthday day just happened to be the same so she sent her greetings with a birthday song. I also reciprocated him a very happy greeting! Thank you for the birthday. My birthday wish is for our country to have a peaceful and honest election. Starting my birthday on the right note by voting early at Don Condrado Barrios Elementary School in Baybay, Roxas City. Go out and cast your vote fellow Filipinos. To all the super moms, moms, moms, moms, moms, or whatever you call them, thank you for the indescribable love.

Hats off to mothers around the world, including the ones in my life: my Mom Judy, my sister Ria, and to the newest Mom - Korina. Happy Mother's Day! For those who have remained silent, and for those who cannot speak ‚Äî you have a chance to let your voices be heard, through your vote, come this election day. Together, we can do this: we can all dream of a better life for our family, and a better future for our children. On the last day of our campaign, I was with my loved ones again. From Dumarao, Sigma, Panitan, Pontevedra, Panay, to Roxas City where I started as a public servant. Thank you so much for your unwavering support. TheOn the last day of our campaign, with my love ones again. From Dumarao, Sigma, Panitan, Pontevedra, Panay, to Roxas City where I started as a public servant. Thank you very much for your tireless support. üíô Last day, last dance (Ang Huling El Bimbo). May kasabihan \"You dance with the one that brung ya.\" I just want to say thank you for all that you've done and all that you do. You've put me in the best position I can be to win. Thank you very much for applying yourself and being fully engaged and even more so, for your malasakit for our country. I am content knowing we've done all we could and even more. I could not ask for more. Let's finish strong. Maraming salamat. The overwhelming support of the Tarlacs has been a source of joy in our fight, including Analyn's great satisfaction when we met at the Victory Uptown Market in Tarlac City. He even offered a prayer for our campaign. Thank you Analyn! The likes of me are the ones that really inspire me to continue our good aspirations for our people. He even packed prayers for our campaign. Thank you so much Analyn! People like you make me more energetic to continue our good ideals for our nation. When Caesar met me at our Victory Uptown Market in Tarlac City, he asked me how I was with former President Manuel A. Roxas. I said my grandfather was the former President of the country. Caesar's reply: 'Well, president, you're so good.' Thank you Caesar. The good and clean name I took care of when it was passed down to me by my parents and also passed on to my children.When Cesar welcomed me in our turn at the Victory Uptown Market in Tarlac City, he asked me how I was President Manuel A. Roxas. Told my grandfather the former President of the country. Cesar's reply: 'He's a good president, that's why you're good at it. Thank you so much Cesar. A great and clean name was what I cared for when my parents gave it to me and I will give it to my children. Nasalubong ko si Nanay Emma sa ating pag-iikot sa loob ng pamilihang bayan ng Sta. Maria sa Bulacan. Ipinahatid niya sa akin ang kanyang pasasalamat sa pagsasabatas natin noon ng Cheaper Medicines Law na ngayon ay nakakatulong na sa kanya at sa marami pang senior citizens para sa kanilang mga maintenance medicines. Ipinaabot niya rin sa akin ang kanyang lubos na suporta dahil naniniwala siya na mas marami pa tayong matutulungan kung mabibigyan ng pagkakataong makapaglingkod muli. Maraming salamat Nanay Emma sa pagtitiwala at walang-patid na suporta!I welcomed Mom Emma on our turn inside the town of Sta. Maria in Bulacan. He sent me his thanks for our enactment of Cheaper Medicines Law which now helps him and more senior citizens for their maintenance medicines. She has also sent me her full support because she believes we can help more if we can give a chance to serve again. Thank you so much Mom Emma for trusting and unseen support! Like their hometowns known for being azucarera, the Ilonggo people in the market town of Passi in Iloilo are full of sweet smiles, greetings, and fun. Thank you very much to you all! Like their town known as Azucarera, full of sweet smiles, hail, and happiness welcomed by the Ilonggo in Pasi town market in Iloilo. Thank you very much to all of you! Rebecca, Monalisa, Virginia, Linette, and Grace, fish vendors, gave me a special kind of greeting during my visit to the Argao town market in Cebu. Thank you for your warm welcome and support! Rebecca, Monalisa, Virginia, Linette, and Grace, fish sellers, on my visit to Argao market town in Cebu. Thank you so much for your warm welcome and support! Tuwang-tuwa si Lorna, tindera ng karne, nang makita niya ako habang nag-iikot sa loob ng pamilihang bayan ng Catarman sa Northern Samar. Nagpaabot siya ng pasasalamat sa atin dahil sa inisyatibo natin noon na ipaayos ang kanilang palengke. Nagagalak siya at hindi raw tayo nakakalimot na bumisita sa kanila sa tuwing tayo ay nagagawi sa kanilang probinsiya. Dahil dyan,  makakaasa aniya tayo sa kanyang patuloy na suporta. Maraming salamat Lorna sa patuloy na pagtitiwala at pagtangkilik!Lorna was so excited, meat seller, when she saw me on the roll inside the Catarman market in Northern Samar. He gave thanks to us for our initiative to get their market repaired. He is delighted that we don't forget to visit them whenever we are in their province. Because of that, we can hope for his continued support. Thank you so much Lorna for the continuous trust and patronage! Philip's face looked so happy when we met at the Bogo Public Market in Cebu. She was in the market to buy what she would feed her pigs. He says he has always seen us on television news and has assured us of his full support in the coming elections. Thanks Felipe! Felipe's face was a trace when we met at the Bogo Public Market in Cebu. She's in the market to choose what she wants to feed her pets. He says he always sees us on television news and assures us of his full support in the coming elections. Thank you, Philip! Halos hindi mapatid na saya at ngiti, bata man o matanda, ang sumalubong sa atin sa loob at labas ng napaka-busy na Obrero Pubic Market sa Blumentritt sa Manila. Maraming salamat sa pagtangkilik at patuloy na pagtitiwala!Almost unkindness of happiness and smile, whether young or old, welcomed us inside and outside the very busy Obrero Pubic Market in Blumentritt in Manila. Thank you so much for patronizing and continuous trust! Isa si Ellen sa mga nakaalala na ilang beses na raw ako bumisita sa Bogo public market kaya malayo pa lang ako sa kanyang puwesto ay agad na niya akong hinatak para kamayan at makapagpalitrato kami. Nagpaabot siya ng kanyang suporta at pasasalamat sa atin dahil hindi raw tayo nakakalimot na puntahan ang kanilang lugar simula pa noong nasa DTI tayo.Ellen is one of those who remembered that I visited the Bogo public market several times so I was just far from her place, she immediately pulled me to have a handshake and we could take a picture. He has sent his support and gratitude to us for not forgetting to go to their place since we were in DTI. Nakilala ko si Angeline at Nanay Julie, parehong nagtitinda ng gulay, noong bumisita ako sa Pritil public market. Upang madagdagan ang kanilang pang-araw-araw na kita, minungkahi ko na bumili sila ng bultuhan o maramihan. Pareho ang kanilang tugon. Gustuhin man nila na gawin ang magandang suggestion natin, kulang sila sa puhunan. Kung hindi sa 5-6 ay sa lokal na kooperatiba sila nangungutang pero kung meron daw mas mahusay na alternatibo, hindi sila magdadalawang isip na sumangguni doon. Maliwanag na kung nais nating makatulong sa mga ordinaryong mamamayan na hindi matatawaran ang kasipagan, kailangan magkaroon ng programa para sa murang pautang. Isa ito sa ating pagtutunan ng pansin sa oras na mabigyan muli ng mandato na makapaglingkod.I met Angeline and Mom Julie, both vegetable sellers, when I visited Pritil public market. To increase their daily income, I suggest they buy bultuhan or bulk. They have the same response. Even if they want to do our good suggestion, they lack capital. If not in 5-6 they borrow money from local cooperative but if there are better alternative, they will not hesitate to refer there. It is evident that if we want to help ordinary citizens with non-negotiable hardwork, we need to have a cheap loan program. This is one of our attention to once again given the mandate to serve. I received a warm welcome from Mom Corazon who, though 72 years old, is still actively shopping at the Pritil market in Tondo. He says when I first ran for Senator in 2004 he was already idolizing me for what we have done at DTI for the range of buyers especially the Price Watch program. Thank you very much Mom Corazon. Such testimonies continue to strengthen our campaign to serve again. We've done a lot and I'm sure there's more we can do for Filipinos. Happy welcome to Mom Corazon who at least 72 years old is still actively shopping at the Pritil market in Tondo. He said that my first run from Senator in 2004 was his idol because of what we did in DTI for the range of buyers especially at Guard Prices program. Thank you very much, Mother Corazon. Such testimonies continue to empower our campaign to serve again. We've done so much and I'm sure we can do more for Filipinos. Full force Otso Direct to the thanksgiving party at UP Sunken Garden. Despite the heavy rain, our supporters did not waver. And they will definitely not be moved on May 13. Thank you for your invaluable support! Even though the rain is heavy, our supporters are not swayed. And they will definitely not be moved on May 13. Thank you very much for your unforgiven support! Korina and myself with our tireless volunteers at UP Diliman campus prior to marching to the UP Sunken Garden for the Otso Diretso Thanksgiving party. Maraming salamat sa patuloy na pagtitiwala. Together, we can make a difference for our country. It is in the market where you can see the real situation of any country. Ours is no different. As we move through various markets, most of the vendors we talk to complained about increasing prices of goods. Consumers also love the price of goods. As such, we are not in favor of petroleum tax under TRAIN law as it is just one of the effects it has on the lives of ordinary Filipinos. It is the market where you can see the real situation of any country. Ours are no different. As we turn around in different markets, majority of the vendors we talked to complained about increasing prices of goods. Buyers also love the price of buy. Because of this, we are not in favor of tax on petroleum under TRAIN law because it is just one of the effects that make the lives of ordinary Filipinos suffer. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre one of more upright and competent candidates that are running for the Senate now so expect my support.‚Äô Iyan ang ipinaabot na mensahe na sadyang nakakataba ng puso ni Mrs. Alinsunurin, isang empleyado ng gobyerno, nang masalubong niya ako sa ating pag-iikot sa loob ng Carbon Public Market sa Cebu City. Thank you Madame for your continued trust and confidence!' You're one of more upright and competent candidates that are running for the Senate now so expect my support. ' That was the message sent that just warms Mrs.'s heart. Alinobedient, a government employee, when he met me in our rotation inside the Carbon Public Market in Cebu City. Thank you Madame for your continued trust and confidence! Kagalakan, pagbati sa aking nalalapit na kaarawan, at pagpapaabot ng suporta ang aking natanggap mula sa aking mga kababayang Ilonggo sa Jaro Public Market kasama si Senator Frank Drilon. Damo gid nga salamat Iloilo!Joy, greetings on my upcoming birthday, and giving support to my fellow Ilonggo fellow countrymen at the Jaro Public Market with Senator Frank Drilon. Thank you very much, Iloilo! Tuwang-tuwa si Corazon, nagtitinda ng karne, nang mapadaan ako sa puwesto niya sa loob ng Carbon public market sa Cebu City. Kuwento niya, 20 taon na raw siya sa kanyang maliit na negosyo at halos lahat ng miyembro ng kanilang pamilya ay nasa ganun ding uri ng kalakalan. Ipinarating din niya ang kanyang suporta sa ating kandidatura dahil aniya sa marami nating nagawa na para sa mga Pilipino, naka titiyak siyang marami pa tayong magagawa kapag muling maka balik sa pag lilingkod.Corazon was very excited, selling meat, when I passed his place inside the Carbon public market in Cebu City. His story, he said he's been 20 years in his small business and most of their family members are in that kind of trade. He also sent his support to our candidacy because of what we have done for Filipinos, he is sure that we can do more when we return to serving. There is nothing like the warmth and all-out support of Ilonggos. Thank you so much for your continued support of my dear friends! Besides being fresh, there are a number of fish for sale at the Carbon public market in Cebu. As I passed Nick's place, I saw a large fish Lapu-Lapu. That's how much support I can expect from him, he said! Thank you Nick! Aside from fresh, fish for sale in the Carbon public market in Cebu has big size. As I passed by Nick's place, I saw the big lapu-lapu fish. That's how big the support I can rely on him is, according to him! Thank you very much Nick! It was a warm welcome filled with sweet smiles as I visited the neat and clean Lucena Town Market. Thank you all! Happy birthday full of sweet smiles I received on my visit to good and clean Lucena Town Market. Thank you so much! Isang mainit na pagtanggap at pagpapakita ng lubos na suporta sa ating laban ang natamo natin sa pagbisita sa Pamilihang Bayan ng mga Produktong Agrikultura sa Quezon sa bayan ng Sariaya, kung saan laging sariwa at abot-kaya ang presyo ng mga gulay. Maraming salamat po!A warm welcome and showing the support of our fight is what we have gained visiting the Agricultural Market in Quezon in the town of Sariaya, where vegetables are always fresh and affordable.

Hindi alintana ni Nanay Rosalia ang magtinda ng gulay sa labas ng Obrero public market sa Blumentritt, Manila kahit na siya ay 82 anyos na at may katarata na sa mata. Ang hinaing niya ay ang kawalan ng paraan para makautang siya ng mura para madagdagan ang paninda niya at pang-araw-araw na kita para mapagamot ang kanyang mata. Karaniwan siyang nangungutang ng 5-6 na sa halip na makatulong ay nababaon lang siya sa utang. Sinimulan natin dati ang SME Unified Lending Opportunities for National Growth (SULONG) Program upang suportahan ang paglago ng mga SMEs sa buong bansa. Kaugnay dito, isusulong din natin na magkaroon ng programa para sa murang pautang ang gobyerno para sa mga maliliit na negosyante, mga nagtitinda sa palengke, mga magsasaka, mga mangingisda, at iba pa, upang makatulong sa pagdagdag ng kanilang kita.Mom Rosalia regardless of selling vegetables outside the Obrero public market in Blumentritt, Manila even though she is 82 years old and has cataract in the eye. His grievance is the absence of a way to borrow money to increase his goods and daily income to treat his eye. He usually borrows 5-6 instead of helping he's just buried in debt. We previously started the SME Unified Lending Opportunities for National Growth (SULONG) Program to support the growth of SMEs across the country. In relation to this, we will also promote the government to have a cheap loan program for small entrepreneurs, market vendors, farmers, fishermen, and others, to help add their income. Punong-puno pa rin ng sigla si Aling Ina sa pagtitinda ng karne sa Maynila kahit 74 years old na siya. Kinamusta natin ang presyo ng kanyang paninda at nasa tamang halaga naman ito. Sabi niya minana pa niya sa kaniyang mga magulang ang maliit na negosyong iyon kaya importante sa kanya na mapanatili ang magandang reputasyon ng negosyo para sa kanilang mga mamimili. Bukod sa Timbangan ng Bayan na naniniguro na nasa tamang timbang ang lahat ng mga paninda sa mga pamilihang bayan, importante rin ang honesty at malinis na reputasyon ng mga nagtitinda para makuha ang tiwala ng mga customers. Kagaya ng ating paghahain sa taong bayan na makapaglingkod muli, baon ko ang sinseridad at malinis na pangalan na ipinamana pa sa akin ng aking mga magulang.Which Mother is still full of vitality for selling meat in Manila even though she is already 74 years old. We said hello to his stock price and it's at the right amount. He said he even inherited that small business from his parents so it's important for him to maintain a good business reputation for their consumers. Aside from the Nation Scale making sure that all the goods in town markets are at the right weight, honesty and clean reputation of vendors are also important to gain the trust of customers. As we sacrifice to the people to serve again, I allowance the sincerity and clean name that my parents gave me. I was impressed by Editha's bravery and determination, a chicken vendor in the Obrero public market. In her 30 years of sales, she graduated from college with her three children who are now professionals. That is our goal for many Filipino families in our country - that as you work and work hard, you will find comfort in your efforts. That will come true if the government becomes a true ally of the people. This is what we look forward to when given the opportunity to serve again. I was impressed by the hardwork and determination of Editha, the chicken seller and the Obrero public market. In his 30 years of selling, he graduated his three children who are now professionals. That's our ideals for many Filipino families in our country - that when you work and continue to work hard, you will achieve comfort caused by your efforts. That would be fulfilled if the government would be a true ally of the people. This is what we will promote once given a chance to serve again. Sabi nila, like father, like son. Noon, ang mga tatay namin. Ngayon, Chel and I find ourselves fighting the same fight as our fathers before us. Happy to be in this with everyone‚Äôs favorite woke lolo Chel Diokno. Kahanga-hanga ang mga kagaya ni Nanay Crising na kahit 82 years old na ay nagtitinda pa rin ng tinapa sa Binan public market. Bukod raw sa pagiging libangan, nagtitinda pa rin siya para sa pang araw-araw na gastos at pambili ng kanyang gamot. Ang mga kagaya ni Nanay Crising ang nais matulungan ng batas na aking isinulong kaugnay sa pag-iipon para sa maginhawang pagreretiro ‚Äì ang Personal Equity and Retirement Account o PERA.It's amazing to be like Mom Crising that even 82 years old are still selling smoked in Binan public market. Besides being entertainment, he still sells for daily expenses and money to buy his medicine. Those like Mom Crising want to be helped by the law I have promoted in relation to saving for convenient retirement - Personal Equity and Retirement Account or MONEY. The Vegetable Farmers Market is a vegetable market in Quezon town of Sariaya. According to Letty, a bag of legumes costs only P35-P40. He added that they were paying a fair price to consumers because of the government's Price Watch program, which we started when I was in DTI. Thanks so much for your story Letty! You can expect us to keep an eye on the price of the commodities when we get back to the service. According to Letty, a bag of string beans is just worth P35-P40. She added, they have a fair price to consumers because of the government Guard program, which we started when I was still in DTI. Thank you so much for your story Letty! You can hope we will continue to watch the price of groceries if we get back to service. Mother Consortia's excitement and energy was contagious when she saw us passing in front of their store outside the Obrero public market in Blumentritt, Manila. His warm greetings included a hug. He expressed his full support for our fight. Thank you for your continued trust. Consortia's happiness and energy was contagious when she saw us pass by in front of their store outside the Obrero public market in Blumentritt, Manila. Her happy greetings are still with embracing. He sent his full support to our fight. Thank you very much for the continuous trust. The warm welcome we received when we visited the Pritil public market in Tondo was heartbreaking. Accepting warmer in summer heat. Thank you Manile√±os for showing your support! Bilang ‚ÄòBangus Capital of the Philippines,‚Äô mura ang daing na bangus sa Magsaysay Fish Market sa Dagupan. Kuwento ni Pau, ang dalawang pirasong medium-sized na daing na bangus ay binebenta niya ng P80. Pero kung tatlong piraso ang bibilhin ay makukuha lang ito sa P100. Lumalabas na nakakadiswento ng P20 sa tatlong piraso. Sa mga mapanuring mamimili, malaking bagay ang mga ganitong klase ng discount dahil magagamit nila ang naitabing pera para sa pagbili ng iba pang kailangan nila mula sa palengke. In a forum I attended, I was asked what must be done to build on the skills of BPO employees. Para sa akin, we need to add tax incentives for BPO companies to train their employees.  The companies themselves can do the training and incentives can be deducted or double deducted from their taxes. These will help the industry keep up with the present-day challenges including artificial intelligence. Kahit mataas ang sikat ng araw at sobrang init ng panahon, sinalubong pa rin tayo ng ating mga kababayan sa Malimgas Public Market sa Dagupan. Kayo ang patuloy na nagbibigay lakas sa akin para ipagpatuloy ang laban! Maraming salamat, Pangasinan! Paglabas natin ng San Carlos public market, sinalubong ako ni Jenny Kris at ng kanyang anak na si John Christian na may suot pang medal mula sa moving-up ceremony sa kanilang paaralan. Ipinaabot ko ang mainit na ‚ÄòCongratulations!‚Äô para sa mag-ina. Naniniwala ako na maipagpapatuloy ni John Christian at marami pang mga kabataang Pilipino ang kanilang pag-aaral at lalaki silang mahusay at may tamang moralidad sa tulong ng 4Ps. Mas palalakasin pa natin ito dahil naniniwala ako na ito ay isang mahusay na investment sa pag-aaral, kalusugan, at magandang hinaharap ng mga kabataang Pilipino. Gising na gising at punong-puno ng sigla ang mga Batangue√±o sa kanilang mainit na pagtanggap sa akin sa pagbisita ko sa Julian Pastor market sa Batangas City. Kitang-kita ang epekto ng kapeng barako sa kanila. Maraming salamat! Bella, vegetable seller and president of market vendors in Lucena is one of our hosts. I was thrilled to learn that he still had a chance to join us at a meeting when I was DTI Secretary of the Price Watch program we started. He also extended his support and their association to our campaign. Thank you so much for your trust! You inspire me to continue my public service. I was amazed at the hard work of Mother Josefa and her husband, Father Teodoro. They are both in their 70s but still selling swordfish in the Malmgas public market in Dagupan. According to Mom, they say shopping is a hobby and they prefer it to staying at home with no worries. Long live you! Here in Legazpi City Public Market, where fruits are always fresh, and smiles are plentiful. Thank you for the warm welcome, Bikolanos! Jane, a seller of chocolates in the town of Sariaya, confirmed that the price has returned to normal. The ceiling fan is P55 per kilogram and the length is P20 per kilogram. Just a few months passed and P900 - P1,000 worth of peppers was a concern for many Filipino buyers. If the government has a good loan program for vegetable farmers, there will be no shortage of produce on any agricultural product that will also help improve the lives of their families. I passed by Vilma, a fish seller in the Lucena town market, who was busy listing the proceeds and spending the day selling them. She says she does that so she knows there is something going on every day. Although not a big deal, it was enough for his family. Thank you so much for your story, Vilma. Your story is also the story of many Filipinos. Regardless of the fatigue and sacrifice just help the family. This is our dream of our country - that when you sacrifice and sacrifice, there is comfort. Maraming salamat sa lahat ng ating nakilala at nakakuwentuhan sa ating pagbisita sa Victory Mall & Market! Kayo po ay aking inspirasyon para ipagpatuloy ang aking pagseserbisyo. Good to be back in San Pablo, known as the City of Seven Lakes! Sa lahat ng inyong mga kuwento, ngiti, yakap, at selfies, maraming salamat! Anywhere we go, it would always feel like home because of your wonderful stories and beautiful smiles. Thank you for your continued support, Pangasinan! Nagulat ako sa nakita kong maliliit na repolyo na tinda ng mag-asawang Ronaldo at Nancy. Kuwento nila, dahil daw ito sa El Ni√±o.  Para sa akin, makakatulong para sa ating mga magsasaka ang pagkakaroon ng murang pautang mula sa gobyerno para sa patubig sa kanilang pananim at iba pang mga kagamitan para madagdagan ang kanilang ani, at tuloy ang kita nila. Isa yan sa ating tutukan kapag nabigyan tayo ng pagkakataong makapaglingkod muli. Tuwang-tuwa si Jennifer at ang kanyang pamilya, na pawang nagtitinda ng isda sa palengke ng San Carlos City sa Pangasinan, noong maka-kuwentuhan ko siya. Singlaki raw ng ganitong bangus ang suporta niya sa ating kampanya! Maraming salamat Jennifer at sa lahat ng mga taga-San Carlos!Jennifer and her family, are so excited to be selling fish at San Carlos City market in Pangasinan, when I chatted with her. This kind of milkfish is as big as he supports our campaign! Thank you so much Jennifer and all the San Carlos fans! Saludo ako sa lahat ng masisipag at tapat na manggagawang Pilipino sa loob o labas man ng ating bansa. Dahil sa inyo mismo na patuloy nagsasakripisyo at nagsusumikap para sa pamilya, lilikha tayo ng mas maraming trabaho. Trabaho na para sa mga Pilipino. Maligayang araw ng mga manggagawa! Nakilala ko ang mag-asawang sina Joseph at Marjorie na nagtitinda ng buko at si Jenny na nagtitinda ng nilagang mais sa labas ng Guagua public market. Ang parehong hinaing nila: gustuhin man nilang palakihin ang kanilang maliliit na kalakal, wala silang makukunan ng karagdagang puhunan para madagdagan ang kanilang kita. Kailangan talagang magkaroon ng programa para sa murang pautang ang gobyerno upang makatulong sa mga MSMEs sa bansa. Siguradong makakatulong ito sa pagpapalago ng ating lokal na ekonomiya. On my return to the Magulgas public market in Dagupan, I was overjoyed by Grace's photographs showing where she and I had been during my earlier visits to the park. Those remembrances, he said, are proof that his support for my ongoing fight has not changed. Thank you! Good to be back in Cagayan de Oro, known as The City of Golden Friendship! Thank you for the warm welcome, Kagayanons! Dahil sa inyo, mas lumalakas ang loob kong ipagpatuloy ang ating laban. Career and real opportunity: this is one of the things we have advanced in congress.

Our senatorial  candidate Atty.  Joan Sheelah \"Josh\" Odan Nalliw is @ Ifugao Provincial  Capitol.... Tatak#50 #50 sa Balota To know more about Atty.  Nalliw..  Tatak#50 sa Senado2019 Atty. JOAN SHEELAH ‚ÄúJosh‚Äù ODAN NALLIW is the daughter of a couple who were both public school educators. She was born at about the same time and hour as the apparition of Our Lady of Medjugorje in Bosnia-Herzegovina (June 24, 1981), she actually preferred, to serve than be served. After finishing her Bacheor of Science in Criminology from the Baguio Colleges Foundation (now University of the Cordilleras) in Baguio City, she went to her home province of Ifugao and became a Prison Guard. While attending duties at the Ifugao Provincial Jail, she pursued post graduate studies at the Saint Mary‚Äôs University in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, taking up Innovative Master in Public Administration (IMPA) and Bachelor of Laws and Letter (Llb). During her off-duty days and semestral breaks, she accompanied and toured around guests and visitors to the famous Rice Terraces of the Cordilleras and organized the Pochon Youth Group to cater to the needs of guests at the same time addressing the community‚Äôs need for additional income from tourism. The same youth organization has been awarded leadership awards and recognition to include the Panibagong Paraan Award in 2008 and being one of the declared Ten Accomplished Youth Organizations (TAYO) in 2010.   Atty. Josh was also one of the delegates to the Civic Participation in the Philippines: North-South Dialogue, a program of the U.S. Department of State at the Northern Illinois University (NU) Dekalb, Illinois in June 2008, along with 29 others from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. After hurdling the 2013 Bar Examinations, she went home to her hometown in Mayoyao to continue serving her community. Despite luxurious offers for her to work in other more improved provinces in the Philippines, Atty. Josh chose to stay behind and serve her community by making use of her profession and other gifts. She may be a lawyer by profession, but at the same time a farmer by occupation having worked personally in the terraced ricefields handed down by her ancestors, experiencing what a normal farmer would experience working in the ricefields.  A staunch advocate of Indigenous Peoples (IP) rights, she has been to summits and dialogues, sometimes as a speaker, involving IP issues in other parts of the country sharing insights and best practices with other IPs. Recently in September 2018, she was invited as a Panelist Speaker at the 4th World Social Welfare Forum at Fukuoka, Japan particularly speaking on the Indigenous Peoples (IPs) Perspective on the Agenda 2030 delivery under the UNESCO Jakarta Office Panel. Having inherited the passion of her parents being educators, she teaches part time at the Ifugao State University, College of Criminal Justice Education, teaching Criminal Law and Jurisprudence subjects. She also travels and lectures the same subjects in different review centers for Criminology Licensure Examination as a National Lecturer.  At present, she is the Indigenous Peoples Mandatory Representative (IPMR) to the Sangguniang Bayan of the Municipality of Mayoyao, the first in Ifugao Province, serving her people as such and have actually authored related legislations in the local government unit. With the young generation close to her heart, Atty. Josh, also called ‚ÄúNanay‚Äù by her wards, is the current Minister and Coordinator of the Youth Ministry of the Our Lady of the Assumption Mission Parish.

Panoorin ang Video: HAPPENING THE DAD: HEART ATTACK? Advice by Dr. Willie Ong As a cardiac specialist, a variety of chest pain is consulted with me. In my estimation, 80 percent of breast disorders have nothing to do with the heart. How do I know that the problem is NOT at heart? The doctor guessed it by telling the patient how he felt. If the pain in the chest seems to be stabbing, that's not the heart. If the pain is on the right side of the chest, then that's not the heart either. Frequency is usually caused by chest pain. You may be sleeping on a hard bed. Mister might have taken over. It may be heavy lifting and it will sprain the flesh. The only solution here is to rest. You can drink mefenamic acid when it really hurts. There are two more questions to check if the pain is from the heart. First, can you point a finger in the chest? When the patient teaches this, it's not the heart. Heart disease cannot be pointed with one finger. Second, how long does it take for your chest to ache? If the pain lasts less than a minute or so and the pain lasts longer than an hour, it's definitely not in the heart. True heart disease lasts from five minutes to 15 minutes. What exactly is heart disease? Chest pain is said to be severe and it may seem like someone is running into the chest. The pain lasts only five to 15 minutes. Pain can come when tired, walk long distances or climb stairs. Men often have heart disease, from 50 years of age or older. If you have obesity, diabetes, or heart disease, there is a high chance that you may have a heart attack. In this case, see a doctor. But when you are young, under 30, especially if you are a woman, I am almost certain that the problem is not in the heart. Don't worry. Check with a heart specialist if needed. Back Pain Treatment Dr Willie Ong's advice THE back and hip pain is common to most people. It starts at age 40 and above. If you are overweight, have a back problem (like Scoliosis), or are not exercising, you will feel it sooner. Why does the back hurt? The most common cause of back pain is muscle strain or sprain, or muscle soreness. It was as if the back was lame. This is due to the force on the back muscles due to (1.) wrong sleep position; (2.) incorrect seating (disrupted); (3.) misbehavior (bored to carry) or overweight; (4.) overweight, and (5.) age (arthritis). What to do? 1. If you are overweight, you need to lose weight. Because your back can't handle the weight of your stomach! 2. Exercise when the back pain is gone. Exercise is very important. 3. Strengthen the mask on our back. Exercise just moderate. We can use a few weights. When our body gets stronger, our back aches. 4. Swim or go to the gym. Swimming is a good motivator for swimming. Work out at the gym slowly too. 5. Don't lift heavy loads. If you have to lift, ask a companion for only half the weight. Squat and use thigh strength to lift the carry. Keep the back straight. Don't stoop to work. That's wrong! 6. Sit back straight. Put a support (small pillow) on our chair to keep our back straight. 7. Don't walk or sit for long. Our backs are weary when stationed. The best thing about the back is the bed. 8. Choose a comfortable bed mattress. Don't be so soft that your back is sluggish. And do not sleep on the pallet because it is too hard. 9. Sleep on the \"s\" body. Lie down. Put pillows for head and neck support. Put a pillow underneath the knee to lift it. The back bend is more comfortable on the back. 10. If you do fall asleep, put a pillow between your thighs. This is so that our thighs don't flex too much and force the back. 11. A warm compress can be placed on our backs. 12. Do not bend or bend the back. It may be distorted. You can massage it slowly to relax the masel. If the disease does not disappear within 2 weeks, consult a rehabilitation medicine doctor or orthopedic surgeon. Good luck. 4 Vital Signs para Mabuhay Sakit sa Katawan tips Payo ni Doc Willie Ong Blood Pressure between 140 highest and 90 lowest.

Iwas din ako sa MAMAHALING campaign materials at advertisement. Bukod dito, may 2 dagdag isyu pa ang iiwasan ko... 1. May mga bashers at naninira na wala sa lugar. Nakita ko na ito ang nag-PAPAMANHID sa pulitiko. Kaya nakakaya niyang gumawa ng MALI tutal isip niya, i-ba-bash naman siya. Para sa aking dapat gamitin ang Bashers para maging CHALLENGE na patunayan na MALI ang iniisip nila. Na matinong tao pala ang bina-bash nila.  2. Sa pulitika, uso ang laglagan at siraan. Maraming pulitiko ang na-iipit sa mga away-away hanggang maging mortal na kaaway. Dahil dito, mas nag focus sila sa pagbagsak sa kalaban KAYSA sa pagtulong sa mahihirap. Medyo NALIHIS sila sa unang misyon na pagtulong sa kapwa. Kaya ako umiiwas sa 2 trap na iyan. Ito strategy ko base sa Biblya. 1. Walang ganti sa bashers. Isang araw, makikita nila na MALINIS at MATINO talaga tayo. At mahal lang talaga natin ang mahihirap. Pati bashers tutulungan din natin. 2. Hindi natin pe-personalin ang paglaglag sa pulitika. Walang sama ng loob. Basta FOCUS lang ako sa misyon na makatulong sa mga mahihirap. Ang tanging KALABAN ko ay Kahirapan at mga SAKIT na pumapatay sa Pilipino. Iyan ang pagtulungan nating lahat lutasin bilang ISANG BAYAN! God bless po. - Doc Willie Ong Note: Sana luminaw ang isipan ng pulitiko at publiko. God bless!

No amount of heat, dust, and hardship can overcome my immense love for all of you.  Whatever the election results may be, I am your Dan Kaibigan. #RoledaSaSenado #RoledaDanKaibigan #56RoledaSaBalota #DiSikatperoTapat A little bit of support and effort will go a long, long way for my senate campaign‚Äîposting of tarpaulins, posters, stickers and giving away of flyers and cards...

You have made my campaign special and worthwhile.‚ù§Ô∏è  #56ROLEDAforSenator #DanKaibiganROLEDA #HindiSikatperoTapat #PamilyaAngBida I went to the Girlstown of the Sisters of Mary School in Talisay, Cebu to give them an inspirational speech but instead, I was the one inspired by them... They touched my heart deeply seeing their resolves to make their lives better, when they practically have nothing but being the beneficiaries of charitable works of the School to provide them free education and all the amenities conducive to make them better persons. I received a very warm welcome with a song presentation from the girls that made me feel like floating while I was walking to the stage! Thank you, Sisters of Mary School and the students for this honor to be with you. I pray to God that He will use me to serve all of you with sincerity and devotion if elected to the Senate. #dankaibiganROLEDA #ROLEDAforSenator #ROLEDA56sabalota #hindisikatperotapat #pamilyaangbida #ROLEDAforYouth For those who do not yet know what the main platform of our senator is- This is \"FAMILY THE WORD\". I plan to create a law called the \"Magna Carta of the Filipino Family\" which will empower every family's rights and benefits under the law. Other programs will include Education, Job generation, Health and Housing reforms that will focus on the masses. üáµüá≠ What a great privilege and honor it is to be invited in the KAPA Founder‚Äôs birthday celebration. Once again, I am humbled by your endorsement and outpouring of support.

Subok na ang karanasan at karunungan ng ating Kaibigan sa Senado dahil siya ay isang Economics graduate at Abogado (magna cum laude at valedictorian). #DanKaibiganROLEDA #ROLEDA56sabalota #ROLEDAforSenator #PamilyaAngBida #HindiSikatPeroTapat Life is a journey that we all take individually. We just have to believe in ourselves knowing that God loves us, when we pray and obey Him. No less than Jesus Christ suffered humiliation as many did not believe in him then and he was crucified and died on the cross for us. Today, everyone believes that He is the son of God, our redeemer. Our own Jesus suffered from the hands of his own people. But He loves us still anyway.  Let us reflect that in our daily lives and in the pursuit of our goals, we have to only focus on Jesus and our relationship with Him. That what we do to each other is a reflection of Jesus. And most importantly, that we forgive those who wronged us and love them still anyway. Have a blessed Holy Week everyone.üôè #dankaibigan #56danroleda #hindisikatperotapat #senatordanroleda I visited the Boystown of the Sisters of Mary School in Minglanilla, Cebu Province. They are either from the poorest of the poor families or abandoned by their parents. They are taken in for free education and free board of lodging. At the same time, they are already taught technical skills to make them ready for gainful employment. I am absolutely touched and inspired by their resiliency, for their ability to recover from their tough and difficult situations. I saw smiles and contentment in their faces.  I am here for you and I will do my very best if elected in the Senate to share all I can to uplift those of you who are in need.

Same with my Senatorial bet #56 Dan Roleda, his disability for being ‚Äônot famous‚Äô in the political arena becomes our advantage in the Senate, because we the voters know that his disability for not being famous or lack of funds will never stop him from serving the country...

I run for the Senate purely because of my passion and desire to give each one of you a better life.‚Äù   ‚ÄúI stand for the love of my Country that I promise to serve with all sincerity and dedication as a true and humble public servant, and to be able to do all that needs to be done to alleviate and improve the lives and the welfare of the Filipino people.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe road ahead has many challenges and the campaign is tough but with God as my strength and you as my inspiration, I shall overcome, not for myself, but for the Filipino people and the country.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wish to thank you all for the outpouring and tremendous support.

I believe YOU made me run for the Senate for a purpose, but YOU also made me strong, and when I run, I feel YOUR pleasure. THY WILL BE DONE. All glory to GOD, through our LORD JESUS CHRIST DAN ROLEDA FOR SENATOR: THE ROAD TO SENATE DAN ROLEDA dreamed big since he was 5 years old as he grew up in Calbayog City, Samar from a merchant family who made it well after the war. His mother was a house helper and his father was a ‚Äúkargador.‚Äù His parents were not able to go to school but Dan and his siblings were sent to Manila as they wanted them to have the best education. He finished basic schooling with honors, and then proceeded to law school. He graduated Magna Cum Laude / Valedictorian, and placed 27th at the Bar exams in 1981. He has been in public service for almost three decades as an outstanding lawyer, a City of Manila councilor, then ALAB Partylist Representative and a Cabinet Member of the Office of the President. He became the Secretary-General of several political parties, head of different government and non- government organizations. He has travelled all over the world and met many world and business leaders. He has established his good name and reputation in the world‚Äôs business and political communities. He has a well-established political and economic foundation for the future that fits him to be a leader of our country. He is indeed the person that our country and our people need for the Senate. Ang ating Hindi Sikat pero Tapat na Kaibigan sa senado ay bumisita sa Cavite upang umani ng suporta  para sa nalalapit na eleksyon.  #DanKaibiganROLEDA #ROLEDAforSenator #ROLEDA56sabalota #PamilyaAngBida Atty Dan Roleda Is A True Friend (KAIBIGAN) Of The Filipino People DAN ROLEDA: THE MAKING OF A GOOD SENATOR The 28 years of outstanding public service record of Atty. DAN ROLEDA is most exemplary and unprecedented in Philippine politics that makes him the best choice to be a senator. Atty. DAN ROLEDA‚Äôs 28-year life as a public servant from being an outstanding lawyer to being a Councilor of the 4th district of Manila (1992-1998), then as a Representative under the ALAB party-list (1998-2001),   and a member of the Cabinet in the Office of the President, exemplifies the commitment, performance, honesty and accountability of a true public servant.  In fact, he donated all his salaries when he was a Councilor, a Representative and a Cabinet Member every month to civic/charitable institutions or causes. To ensure impartial and effective allocation of projects such as feeder roads, public school buildings, health centers, sundrying equipment and others, he channeled the implementation thereof thru the Engineering Department of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. His almost three decades of serving the public molded his qualifications and strength to become a good senator. ‚ÄúThe public deserves no less from a public servant but to serve the country with full credibility, integrity and dignity.‚Äù Atty. DAN ROLEDA is fully competent and experienced to be a Senator that will formulate and cause the enactment of laws for the welfare and benefits of  the Filipino people Kaibigan‚Äôs journey is filled with love and passion and it now resonates in Batangas with the endorsement of incumbent Gov. Mandanas.‚òùÔ∏è #DanKaibiganROLEDA #ROLEDAsaSenado #56ROLEDAsabalota #pamilyaangbida Our Kaibigan in the Senate brings his heart and mission to the province of Batangas with the blessing of incumbent Gov.

You entrusted me with the duties and responsibilities to uplift and help the poor and the development of the our beloved City. The records would show that I was faithful and dedicated to the trust and confidence you have given me. From being a City Councilor, I then became a Party List representative under ALAB in 1998 and was appointed in 2001 until 2010 as the Presidential Adviser for Foreign Investments.  Almost 28 years have passed, and now,  I am running to be a Senator of our country.

Grace Poe. The FPJPM formerly Fernando Poe Jr. for the Presidential Movement, on Monday endorsed Poe‚Äôs reelection bid, along with six other candidates. In 2012, Brian recalled that FPJPM was the first group to express backing for his mother during her first senatorial run. \"This year 2019, you are still here and helping because you believe Senadora Grace Poe's service is a true and genuine service for people who really need help,\" Brian said as he represented his mother at the group's event in San Juan City Monday. Poe, an independent candidate, was unable to personally attend due to earlier set campaign activities in General Santos and Koronadal. \"He has no party, he is not in the administration, he is not in the opposition, you are his party, the people are his party like FPJ was,\" Brian told the crowd composed mostly of fans of the late National Artist Fernando Poe Jr., the senator's father.

In the hearing in Comelec byon April 2  on the case GADON vs SWS and Pulse Asia .. my lawyer ATTY AL VITANGCOL was able to establish that the method of SWS and Pulse do not conform to the least number of acceptable practice using 99 % confidence level.. and the minimum sampling of 16,000 respondents and a margin of error of 1%..  In contrast SWS and PULSE uses only 1,500  and 1,800 respondents with confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 3- 4 % ..  This clearly points out that the surveys are bogus , unreliable , not scientific and statistically anomalous and unaceptable considering that there are 55 Million registered voters spread over 7,100 islands , 42,000 barangays , 87 provinces with diverse diffenrences on regional , cultural , gender , age , religious and educational preferences . The sampling of 1,500 and 1,800 are clearly unreliable . It becomes an election propaganda for purposes of mind conditioning for a band wagon effect.  It was also established that under the Fair Elections Act , it is prohibited for the surveys to be published in media , to which SWS used the idiotic lame  excuse that SWS did not publish it and it was the clients  who released the surveys to the media.  When asked by the Comelec if SWS tells the clients not to publish as provided under the Fair Electionsn Act and if this provision is included in the contract , SWS said they tell the clients but they cant show the contract as the SWS lawyer has no copy .  Another anomaly was discovered when Pulse Asia was not represented in the hearing. The Commision Secretary reported that the Comelec sheriff can not locate the address given in the petition and when they checked the website of Pulse Asia it had the same bogus address .

FACT CHECK No, ballot machine testing doesn‚Äôt show ink from vote seeping through to other candidate. PLEASE SHARE, SHARE, SHARE!!! Thanks to all A warning circulating on social media claiming that votes cast for senatorial candidate Lito Lapid could be counted in favor of Mar Roxas is wrong. The post, which says ballot ovals shaded for Lapid will bleed through and fill out Roxas‚Äô oval, has been debunked by Commission on Elections (Comelec) spokesperson James Jimenez himself. The message claims to have originated from an unnamed Davao-based vote counting machine (VCM) technician who \"recently conducted a final testing and sealing of ballots (I hope this will clarify everything.)

Ginagawa nito ang kanyang trabaho na ilayo sa posibleng security risk ang bansa natin.‚Äù In an internal memorandum dated January 25, the DFA had cautioned the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), the National Security Council, and the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) as European countries such as France and Czech Republic limited the use of Huawei products due to cyber security risks.  In December, Japan had also barred Huawei from participating in public procurement. Meanwhile, the Magdalo solon cited anew the conflict between two countries in the West Philippine Sea.  ‚ÄúI have always reiterated that we must be circumspect in dealing with China because we have an existing territorial conflict with them. Lahat ng bilateral agreements at partnerships  ay maikakabit sa nangyayaring pang-aagaw ng ating mga teritoryo sa West Philippine Sea. I have repeatedly warned the government not to rely on China for the country‚Äôs critical security infrastructures. Hindi dapat nailalagay sa kompromiso ang pambansang seguridad alang-alang sa ‚Äòdi umano‚Äôy pagkakaibigan ng dalawang bansa. ‚ÄúHinihikayat ko ang ating gobyerno na sundin ng payo ng DFA.

Live na live ang Ilonggong Sundalo ng Pilipino #GaryAlejano sa Bombo Radyo Roxas City, Capiz #GaryAlejano on hundreds of Chinese vessels near Hope: Gov't has been warned but didn't act I have repeatedly warned the government of China's gradual control of the Hope Island sandbars. Two years ago, August 2017, I first released to the public the massing of Chinese Coast Guard, Chinese Navy and maritime militia in the sandbars of Pag-asa Island. In October 2017, I released another report of Chinese maritime militias and Chinese Navy warding off Philippine vessels conducting patrol from the sandbars. The Duterte administration tagged the information I released as fake and called me a liar even when an independent thinktank verified the information. Now, look where we are. What used to be few vessels grew to 600 vessels circling Pag-asa Island now according to the AFP Western Command. The government has been warned two years ago, but President Duterte and his cohorts only downplayed the incidents. The President has never taken seriously the issue of China's seizure of our territory and the abuse of our fishermen and soldiers. As I have said before, China will continue to assert control in the Pag-asa Island sandbars despite the \"friendly\" relations that the administration is trying to foster. The sandbars are critical to China‚Äôs claim of the Subi Reef. If China seizes Sandy Cay, they will be able to claim Subi Reef as part of the territorial sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSandy Cay. While it is a positive development that the AFP is starting to be transparent on the real situation in the West Philippine Sea, I urge the Duterte administration to act on the rising number of Chinese vessels around Pag-asa Island and protest China's illegal actions. China is establishing a norm there which we cannot alter later on. Every day is a wasted opportunity to assert our sovereignty if we do not act now. #SundaloNgPilipino #WPS #AtinTo I call on the Filipino people to support the remaining bastions of democracy. Press freedom is not only for journalists but for the people who deserve the truth through critical and independent reporting.  #DefendPressFreedom #SundaloNgPilipino #AlejanoSaSenado The administration has since filed a lawsuit against Maria Ressa and other critics but has been silent on allies and friends of druglords. It is here that the administration focuses its attention instead on protecting our fishermen in the West Philippine Sea, studying China's admitted loans, and suppressing drug trafficking. The Duterte administration has twisted priorities and selfish interests. #SundaloNgPIlipino #GaryAlejano # 5Alejano #AlejanoSaSenado Ako ay nakikiisa at nagbibigay-pugay sa ating mga kasama sa Philippine Army sa kanilang ika-122 taong anibersaryo. 122 taong pagpapamalas ng inyong pambihirang tapang at dedikasyon, at bukod-tanging pagseserbisyo at sakripisyo para sa Inang Bayan at sa bawat Pilipino.

Again, there are legal procedures that should be observed regarding this matter. If the administration has solid evidence, then file appropriate charges and let them roll in the courts. The problem is, time and again, the list have been proven inaccurate, and even the President himself admitted to this. The public-shaming that the government is resorting to is aimed to intimidate and control the local politicians in the coming elections. This is also a mere show of bravado to make the people believe that the war on drugs is working. It is not. Hangga‚Äôt may mga pinapapasok pa ring droga sa ating bansa, mga inaabsweltong bigtime druglords at mismong mga nasa poder ang protektor, alam nating peke ang giyera kontra-droga ng administrasyong Duterte. Nasisira lamang ang ating mga institusyon at niyuyurakan ang ating mga karapatang-pantao habang hindi naman nalulutas ang problema sa droga. Para tayong nasa narcoserye na ang pabida ay ang Pangulo. Paulit-ulit lamang ang mga patutsada, maglalabas ng mga pangalan, magkakaroon ng susunod na kabanata pero wala namang nakukulong. #SundaloNgPilipino #GaryAlejano EJK ENABLERS WILL PAY THE PRICE IN FULL - ALEJANO Malaca√±ang can repeatedly shrug off the looming ICC probe like a broken record, but it can and will prosecute this administration‚Äôs war on drugs. Even the country‚Äôs withdrawal from the ICC will not spare it from the clutches of justice once the war on drugs, which have claimed thousands of Filipino lives, is proven to be a crime against humanity. Article 127 of the Rome Statute clearly provides that no State, despite its withdrawal can be exempted from its obligations during such time that it was a Party to the Statute. Also, regardless of a public announcement by the ICC, I was personally informed by delegates of its member states during a convention in Ukraine that it could open the case against the war on drugs anytime soon. In light of this, all concerned authorities are expected to cooperate with the upcoming proceeding. I call on them not to be swayed by partisanship, but rather commit fully to their mandate to serve the people. Wala dapat sa iisang tao ang kanilang katapatan. They must first and foremost uphold human rights, one of the pillars by which this country was founded on. Dahil mistulang nabibingi na ang hustisya dito sa Pilipinas, kinakailangang litisin ang mga krimen ng administrasyong ito sa isang hukumang hindi nito mababayaran o masisindak. The success of the ICC probe will reiterate this country‚Äôs commitment to protect and promote human rights. EJK enablers will soon pay the price in full. #SundaloNgPilipino #GaryAlejano What we want the Malaca√±ang to respond to in this matter is how to resolve the problem and not how to defend Mr.'s statement. Tulfo. The administration is more open to the Chinese than the Filipinos. The contemptuous remarks of Mr. Tulfo show just how out of touch he is to the harsh reality that our workers have to consistently deal with. Low pay, lack of benefits, and poor working conditions are the primary reasons why our construction workers prefer to work overseas. They do not deserve denigration, more so, in favor of Chinese nationals stealing the jobs that could have been for them. Instead of being dismissed, we should help our workers to develop their skills and stop treating them unfairly. Three years have passed and the promise of our OFWs that they have to return home to work remains a promise. There must be a clear plan for resolving it appropriately, not that we are still importing foreign labor. Ultimately, Chinese workers are preferred because China's interests are preferred by our government. This administration and many of its cohorts would stoop so low as spit on our people‚Äôs good name in exchange for China‚Äôs good graces. #SundaloNgPilipino #GaryAlejano Pangulong Duterte, Huwag mong maliitin ang sakripisyo ng MAGDALO at ng mga SUNDALO. #SundaloNgPilipino #GaryAlejano #Alejano5 #Magdalo138 #AlejanoSaSenado This is my answer to you President Duterte My words are grounded in action. It is not like promising to jetski and fight the West Philippine Sea but ultimately bowing to China's wishes in exchange for a loan from them. This is not like promising to end criminality and illegal drugs within 3 to 6 months. It's going to be three years. You just deceived the people. Thousands of ordinary Filipinos have been killed by your war on drugs, but I do not remember losing tons of shabu to the country.

This time blocks of cocaine worth P200 million were recovered in the shorelines of Davao Oriental and Nueva Ecija. This is alarming and puzzling. Three years of government's crackdown on illegal drugs and thousands of drug suspects killed did not deter the continuous entry of drugs in our country. Those who continue to bring in illegal drugs are obviously confident that the government will not go after them. They trust their backers in government. The question is: who really is involved in the illegal drug trade in our country? The drug war is a failure. Druglords continue to be safe and secure in the hot eyes of our government as poor and small drug suspects are targeted and killed. If the numbers provided by the President are true, instead of reducing the number of drug-related incidents, it is likely to increase. Even the Colombian cartel has reached it. Yet Malaca√±ang still claims that the drug war has been a success. It was not. That is why the administration is asking for another three years to fulfill its promise of eradicating illegal drugs. However, the extension that the administration is asking for would only mean extended policy of killing poor drug suspects who will never be afforded due process under the present administration. #SundaloNgPilipino #GaryAlejano #AlejanoSaSenado # Alejano5 # Magdalo138 Bong ...

If you plan your life ahead of time and you know exactly what you want, then that will serve you as a motivation on how are you going to face the challenges that you are going to meet on your battle ground.  Albani started from asking on what is happening on his surroundings, he try to look for answers but unfortunately no one could give him the right one. That is why he started to build a foundation that will help the community and start fulfilling his dream not only for the Filipinos but also with other nations. As he formed a global foundation he visualized the unity of modern society, living with prosperity and full of happiness with a peaceful mind to stop worrying from the bad things that might happen. This is also to preserve the civic rights of each family here in our country to uplift the living conditions of their well-being in the community.  A simple citizen who proved many things for his fellowmen because in your own simple ways you can already do that without asking anything in return. Just like what Albani said ‚ÄúTo make our country permanently strong and progressive, we must rise above a unitary system of government, honor our ethnic diversities as Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio envisioned. We must break down barriers and stereotypes that foment distrust, suspicion, and bigotry.‚Äù https://sialbani.org www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaSENADO #ALBANIparasatunaynaPAGBABAGO READ: End Divisions From The Past  \"Our colonial past has divided our nation into Christians, Muslims, and tribal communities but if religion is part of the problem it can be part of the solution.\" Albani said. Bakit kailangan nating magkawatak-watak ng dahil sa relihiyon ba meron tayo? Hindi ba't sa iisang Diyos din tayo ng galing? Nagkaroon man ng iba't-ibang paniniwala pero kung pagsusumahin halos magkakapareho lang din dahil may iba-ibang tema at pagtuturo sa pagbuo ng storya.  Kung pananatilihin natin ang pangyayari sa nakaraan, paano ang ating kasalukuyan? Mananatiling magkakaroon ng pader sa pagitan ng Kristiyano, Muslim, at Katutubo. Kung pader ang problema sa mga relihiyon na ito bakit hindi ito ang panahon para ito ay tibagin. Dahil kung mawawala ang pader na nakaharang sa bawat isa, sa bawat problema ng kahaharapin ng bansa, ang pagkakaisa at pagtutulungan sa konklusyon ang magiging sagot dahil sa iba't-ibang pamamaraan na pwedeng ihandog ng bawat isa. www.sialbani.org www.unityforrevival.com www.wpf-unesco.org #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaBAYAN Remembering our heroes during World War II READ: Spark something from nothing From chaos there will be light, the light that will serve as the hope and future for the people who can‚Äôt stand for themselves. The spark that will light endlessly not as a blast going to different places, but a blast that sparks together. A community who dream together is more powerful rather than a person who dream all by himself. But the community who had no one to guide them is inadequate because they will be in different directions.  ‚ÄúWe will spark something from nothing.‚Äù Albani. A person could not provide the things that he will be needing if he will not make a way, a person could not also do what he wants if no one supports his journey, a person could not have a first step if he did not dream this before.

In five rounds of pure wit, the senate hopefuls addressed every concern one issue at a time. From the territorial disputes in the West Philippine Sea to the demand for Same Sex Marriage, the candidates exhibited their platforms and intent should they be elected for a seat after May 18 in front of the Green Archers and guests in attendance. Asked to comment on Hugpong ng Pagbabago Chairman Sara Duterte‚Äôs remarks about honesty, Albani, Peace Advocate and businessman, highlighted that the root of the problems in the Philippines is in dishonesty itself. Javellana seconded this by explaining that honesty is the foundation of true leadership. De Guzman was also on board with this as he explained that dishonest leaders have no place in the government. Liberal Party senatorial bets, Tanada and Gutoc, took the statements a step further by saying that the Presidential Daughter was clearly protecting Former President Ferdinand Marcos‚Äô daughter, Imee Marcos. Gutoc went as far as advising Duterte to ‚Äúplease go back to school‚Äù which earned thunderous applause from listening students. Other issues the candidates took on was the water shortage plaguing the Metro in the past few days, the Kaliwa Dam displacement of Indigenous People, reinstitution of the Death Penalty, Pork Barrel, Federalism, and other critical concerns.

This is not about having money to meet the basic necessities of a person. Poverty is more than just not having the money. The World Bank Organization describes it as ‚ÄúPoverty is hunger. Poverty is lack of shelter. Poverty is being sick and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, is fear for the future, living one day at a time.‚Äù Poverty has many faces and as time passes people describes it in many ways, most often poverty is a situation people want to escape. Today is the time for a call to change the world because we can now eliminate poverty in five (5) years to start the Filipinos to have enough food to eat, adequate shelter, quality of education, protection from violence, and voice that should be heard by the government. Every Filipino family has the right to own a home regardless of economic status in Albani‚Äôs administration increasing the economic, socialized and low-cost housing by a (Php 10/day), which will be equivalent to more families who would be able to have a house of their own and a business for the family. https://sialbani.org/issues/poverty-elimination/ www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaBAYAN #ALBANIparaPAGBABAGO YES/NO: Do you agree with Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte's stand on honesty? | #TheFilipinoVotes http://bit.ly/2Yl7L6U #CNNPHILIPPINES www.sialbani.org www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaBAYAN #ALABNIparasaPAGBABAGO Shariff Albani: There's no justice for the poor in the country | #TheFilipinoVotes http://bit.ly/2Yl7L6U #CNNPHILIPPINES www.sialbani.org www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaBAYAN #ALABNIparasaPAGBABAGO YES/NO: Would you support ending contractualization once and for all? | #TheFilipinoVotes http://bit.ly/2Yl7L6U #CNNPHILIPPINES www.sialbani.org www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaBAYAN #ALABNIparasaPAGBABAGO Shariff Albani: I would propose an inter-faith department | #TheFilipinoVotes http://bit.ly/2Yl7L6U #CNNPHILIPPINES www.sialbani.org www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaBAYAN #ALBANIparasaPAGBABAGO YES/NO: Should candidates with criminal or administrative cases be allowed to run? | #TheFilipinoVotes http://bit.ly/2Yl7L6U #CNNPHILIPPINES www.sialbani.org www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaBAYAN #ALABNIparasaPAGBABAGO Shariff Albani: Honesty is a basic requirement to be a good leader | #TheFilipinoVotes http://bit.ly/2Yl7L6U #CNNPHILIPPINES www.sialbani.org www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaBAYAN #ALBANIparasaPAGBABAGO Our very own Shariff Ibrahim Albani shared the hotseat with fellow candidates, Mel Chavez, Lady Ann Sahidulla, and RJ Javellana for a special coverage of the CNN The Filipino Votes Forum, March 24.

A government consisting of everyone from the same background will only have the same thoughts, solutions, and even ignorance. We believe we can advance further and faster by bringing together people from various backgrounds, each with different life experiences, to generate ideas that others may not have been aware of. By acknowledging what makes us different in culture and beliefs, we accept what we all have in common: Filipinos who want peace, tolerance, and change for the better. Due to recent events, people have turned their fear on terrorism and Martial Law to those affected. But through good governance and poverty elimination, movements on institutionalized inter-faith and inter-cultural reconciliation can be implemented among Muslim, Christian and indigenous people. By having Filipinos from different walks of life come together, we strengthen communities and affect more change. Acceptance grows while discrimination diminishes. Now, more than ever, we need to stand against poverty and corruption to bring peace and wealth to the Filipinos. https://sialbani.org/issues/peace-unity/ www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaBAYAN #ALABANIparasaPAGBABAGO ALBANI'S PRIORITIES  Good Governance Education. Blockchain. Federalism. These would be the main focus on modernizing the Philippine system as we enter the era of globalization. Education One of the most notable milestones in Philippine education is that the government actively seeks to expand access and participation in higher education and, even more importantly, tries to improve the quality of education. 5 out of 10 Filipino families are deprived of basic education based on the latest data of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), it showed that the education sector had the largest share to the overall deprivation at 36.5% and 36.9% in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Education not only gives more economic and financial advantages to the Filipinos, but it is also a right of every citizen by simply increasing the financial support system of the masses in the rural and urban areas. This is to ensure the future of the Filipino youth. Federalism A recent survey by Pulse Asia found that 67% of Filipinos oppose the change, while only 18 percent were in favor and the other 14 percent were undecided. The Philippine government cites lack of information as the reason for low public support, people know little about Federalism‚Äôs issue. There is clearly much work to be done in terms of spreading awareness and knowledge on the aforementioned issue. This will also centralize major cities which create poverty in neglected regions and overcrowding in the major cities as more people try to find jobs. With federalism, true national stability will be established wherein each region is more empowered and better equipped in governing themselves. Since they are more aware of their region‚Äôs needs, they‚Äôll be able to use the tax given effectively. Blockchain Technology With the controversies that followed Smartmatic voting machines, Albani and his administration propose using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is a transparent data recording system that‚Äôs almost impossible to hack with many copies being distributed and updated at the same time in every part of the country. With blockchain technology, the vote numbers are automatically public while the voters remain anonymous. Democracy is then reclaimed as people‚Äôs true power: their choice. https://sialbani.org/issues/good-governance/ www.unityforrevival.com #4saBALOTA #ALBANIanginyongKAKAMPI #ALBANIparasaSENADO #ALBANIparasatunaynaPAGBABAGO Happening now;  Nasa enbarcadero convention center Legaspi City Albay Province si Senator Shariff Ibrahim Albani upang ipaalaam sa samabayanan ang tunay na solusyon sa PAGBABAGO at KAPAYAAN sa ating bansa.

You know we, little people, really need to be together so that we are never misunderstood and underestimated! :) # 22Colmenares #KakampiSaSenado As we've seen before, shutdowns and interruptions can be used to justify price increases. ‚ÄúWe need to find out who is profiting from these power plant shutdowns, because electricity prices literally went [through] the roof [on] the WESM.‚Äù ‚Äî #22Colmenares #KakampiSaSenado  https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/‚Ä¶/luzon-grid-placed-on-red-al‚Ä¶ Regardless of government playing with poverty incidence numbers, we all know that poverty is still the fundamental crisis of nation. And things are getting worse. Last year it was the rising cost of goods, a rice \"shortage,\" and oil price hikes. This year it's been water service interruptions and brownouts, which are being used as excuses to increase water and electrical charges, alongside more price hikes. Crisis after crisis and yet government does nothing but reveal itself to be lacking in preparedness, if not lacking in compassion for the people. #WeDeserveBetter #22Colmenares #KakampiSaSenado  (video courtesy of Bagong DUGO.) \"To treat China in this Petition like any ordinary State creditor is a major mistake. The Chinese government is sloppy and cannot be trusted.\" - We've been saying this for a long time: #China is cunning. It does not play fair, and it has revealed itself not as an ally or friend, but as a foe that's only looking out for its own interests. #AtinAngPinas # 22Colmenares #KakampiSaSenado https://news.abs-cbn.com/‚Ä¶/colmenares-groups-ask-supreme-co‚Ä¶ Know Neri #22Colmenares In a time of crisis, we need people in government who will stand with the people, who will work without selfish interests, who will take on the tasks of lawmaking and investigation seriously. In a time of growing poverty and price hikes, dictatorial tendencies and various forms of State violence, we need someone who has a proven track record of fighting oppression on all fronts.  Neri Colmenares is ‚Äî and has always been ‚Äîthat person. His nine years as Congress Rep of Bayan Muna reveals that he has worked not just with an ear to the ground, but with his heart in the right place. The laws he has authored range from basic services such as the public text message warnings for storms and calamities (RA 10639), to services for the disenfranchised such as the special election precincts for PWDs and senior citizens (RA 10633). He authored the law that increased the SSS pension for senior citizens and retirees by P2,000.00 ‚Äî a fight that he continues in the present, as the second half of the amount has been promised for 2019.  Being a Martial Law survivor and human rights lawyer, he authored the Anti-Torture Law and Anti-Enforced Disappearances Law to ensure that the evils of martial rule will not happen again. He authored RA 10368 which acknowledges and compensates victims of Marcos‚Äôs Martial Law.  As a lawyer, Colmenares has brought various petitions to the Supreme Court, taking the side of the people versus unjust price hikes of basic services and utilities. In 2013, he successfully fought against the highest price hike that Meralco wanted to impose on its subscribers. In 2015, he did the same versus Maynilad and Manila Water. That same year he also effectively fought the MRT and LRT price hikes benefitting all commuters. Currently, he has a petition with the Supreme Court versus telcos‚Äô overcharging of subscribers and its slow internet services. In 2019, Colmenares stands strong in his conviction that the rising cost of basic goods, utilities, and fuel is something that government can and should address. He waits for the Supreme Court decision on the petition he filed with Bayan Muna versus the TRAIN Law and its unjust taxation, the effects of which we all felt with the highest inflation rate in 10 years, and the uncontrolled price hikes of 2018.  From the streets, to the courts, the House of Representatives, and on to the Senate, Colmenares is that same person who has fought for your rights, raised his voice about the issues that matter, and stood on the right side of history no matter how difficult or unpopular.  The truth is, regardless of whether or not you know Neri, if you use electricity and consume water, if you use public transport and fuel, then you have benefitted from the battles he has dared fight for the people.  And for that reason alone, he deserves your vote. *** Why the administration‚Äôs utterly defeatist stance on the plight of our fishermen in the West PH Sea? Why ignore the continued harassment and denial of access to their traditional fishing grounds?

Press conference of the Peoples Choice Movement on their endorsement of 10 senatorial candidates including Neri Colmenares. #22Colmenares Thank you to the Concerned Artists of the Philippines for hosting this event and joining us in our journey to the Senate! #22Colmenares #KakampiSaSenado Simple lang ito: hindi dumaan sa tamang proseso ang Meralco sa pagpili ng sarili nilang affiliate power generating companies. At pinabayaan sila ng Energy Regulatory Board na gawin ito. Sa huli, taumbayan na naman ang magbabayad ng mas malaking singil sa kuryente dahil sa tinatawag na \"sweetheart deals\" na ito. Kaya tayo nangalampag sa Meralco, kaya patuloy tayong mangangalampag. #22Colmenares #KakampiSaSenado #KalampagNiColmenares  https://www.gmanetwork.com/‚Ä¶/colmenares-zarate-seek-t‚Ä¶/story Things Few People Know About Neri Colmenares (1) is a CHESS CHAMPION. He really wanted to be the lead singer of the band, but not intended. So he ended up playing chess. His 2016 Senatorial bid was endorsed by Chess Grand Masters Eugene Torre and Jayson Gonzales. (2) Neri is a frustrated SINGER. He used to have a band in high school, and was playing guitar. But he did say: his GOOD LOOKS was a non-lead singer, so his singing career ended quickly. His son Bien though does a mean beat box. (3) It was his involvement in the STUDENT COUNCIL and in the YOUTH CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS Student Christian Movement (SCM) and the Student Catholic Action of the Philippines (SCAP) that would bring him to ACTIVISM. He was jailed twice during Martial Law, first as a teenager in Bacolod in the 70s, and as a member of the youth sector in Tuguegarao in the 80s. He was tortured at the same time and released after the EDSA 1986 Revolution. (4) Neri was born to parents who were both from the WORKING CLASSES. His mother was a government employee. My father started out as a security guard, working as a bank employee. His parents' experiences as members of the working class are at the heart of Neri's fight for just wages, higher pensions, and against contractualization. (5) He is related to ANGEL LOCSIN, whose real last name is Colmenares. It's a bit strange of course that Neri is technically Auntie, but the difference between the two is that they are both CONVENIENT and BAD. And it's not just for show. Instead it's about keeping both feet on the ground, and even better, their ear to the ground. (6) Neri is a POLYGLOT. He can speak multiple languages: English, Filipino, but also Ilonggo, Cebuano, and Ilocano. This is also why he can work with the needs of the people, because he can understand them across languages. All of us, no matter what language, will join our Senate. (7) He is FUNNY. And he is self-deprecating. She's not just cool and calm TITO NERI. He is also the funny Tito at the reunion who has a lot of passion about things, but when you need help with serious things you also know that you can approach and seek good advice. And of course: who else can get away with a #CallMe handsign, but #Colmenares himself? *** # 22Colmenares #ContainsSenado #NeriColmenares # Elections2019 # Senate2019 # Elections2019 Sumama po tayo sa pagkilos ng Bayan Muna kaninang umaga para kalampagin ang Manila Water sa bulok nilang serbisyo. Hindi katanggap-tanggap ang kanilang paliwanag na mababa ang supply ng tubig kaya pumapalpak ang kanilang serbisyo. Mismo MWSS, NRWB at PAGASA ang nagsasabi na may sapat na supply. Ang totoong problema ay palpak na management ng private concessionaire. NERI COLMENARES PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATOR.  As a three-term congressman for Bayan Muna and Senior Deputy Minority Leader of the 16th Congress, Neri successfully fought for the P2,000 increase in the SSS pension. He authored many laws including that on free text alerts during calamities, special election precincts for persons with disabilities and senior citizens, and the recognition and compensation of Martial Law victims.  PEOPLE‚ÄôS LAWYER.  Neri is the President of the National Union of People‚Äôs Lawyers, dedicated to working for the impoverished and oppressed peoples. He has a pending case in the Supreme Court to junk the TRAIN Law. He led efforts to successfully prevent the increase in power rates in 2013 and filed a case against water rates hike in 2015. He has a pending petition against the overcharging of telco giants Globe, Smart, and PLDT, and for better internet services.  COURAGEOUS ACTIVIST.  Not one to waver in his convictions, Neri has always stood on the side of the poor and oppressed. Four years of being jailed and tortured during Marcos‚Äôs Martial Law did not silence him. Instead it strengthened his belief in the fight for freedom, democracy, and justice. PERSON OF INTEGRITY.  Born and raised in Negros, son of a government clerk and security guard, a model husband and father. Neri never amassed wealth in his years in Congress. Kind, compassionate, and easy to talk to, he is someone we can depend to fight the battles that matter most to the people.  #ColmeNeri #22Colmenares If something needs to be fixed, it needs a break. I am your opponent in the fight and a bigot in the Senate. # 22Colmenares #KalampagNiColmenaresIf something needs to be fixed, it needs a bang.

It looks like the President is promising 3 to 6 months at a time but 3 years on the drug has yet to be solved, ‚ÄùDe Guzman said. The labor leader lamented the \"salaries and programs delayed\", saying that \"it should make civil servants and voters rethink their support for the administration for the mid-term election.\" \"The PDP-Laban has also not helped recruit former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who is notorious for deliberately slashing the budget for easier manipulation,\" he said. De Guzman noted that this is the longest budget delay since 2003, under the Arroyo administration. This was followed by a re-enacted budget in 2004. The budget was re-enacted in 2001, 2004, and 2006 under Arroyo. Budget Reforms De Guzman notes that budget delay ‚Äúis a natural consequence when of a patronage-driven fiscal process, where representatives and technocrats and not the people themselves discuss the budget.‚Äù \"Naturally, if they are just talking, they don't care if the budget is delayed or enacted because what they need to do is secure their pet projects,\" De Guzman said. He notes that the budget process is \"transformed into a game of dare\" among politicians, \"while people expecting their salaries and government services are left to suffer.\" ‚ÄúWhat we need is reform to make the budget process participatory. DBM (Department of Budget and Management) and the House Committee on Appropriations should not only talk to the people themselves, ‚ÄùDe Guzman asserted. He explained that his campaign platform includes a proposal to \"make participatory budget, and mandate barangay level discussion on national budget levels and priorities and local government budget items.\" \"There is a need for the people to participate in determining how much to spend on education, housing, health, and more, in conjunction with discussions on specific budget items in the budget of the LGU (local government units),\" he added. De Guzman vowed to do this by recommending revisions to Executive Order 292 or the 1987 Revised Administrative Code, as well as the Local Government Code. ### Reference: Leody de Guzman 0920-5200672 Labor Win's Ka Leody De Guzman said he would not expect administration allies to join debates, as doing so would supposedly expose their anti-people interests and agendas \"The dancing and singing are performed by candidates who cannot promise the workers \"We challenge them who will stand up to the wages of workers in the province on the wages of the workers in Metro Manila, not to rise, because it is definitely (contrary to) the capitalists who support it,\" said De Guzman. and singing are the resorts of a candidate who cannot promise anything to a laborer. We challenge them who can push for the equality of provincial wage rates and Metro Manila wage rates, they will never stand up for that because that is against the interests of the capitalists who support them.)

Section 26(B) of Book VI, Executive Order (EO) 292, or the ‚ÄúRevised Administrative Code of 1987‚Äù, states that principal and interest payments for government debts are automatically appropriated. The provision is copied from Section 31(B) of Presidential Decree (PD) 1177 or the ‚ÄúBudget Reform Decree of 1977‚Äù which also serves as the legal basis for Section 26(B).  De Guzman explained that repealing Section 26(B) of EO 292 and Section 31(B) of PD 1177 would ‚Äúact as a deterrent to unscrupulous creditor countries who might want to exploit corrupt administrations.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOne of my first bills would be to replace automatic debt payments with automatic audit of loan agreements involving stakeholders, the economic team of Congress, third party accountants, and civil society,‚Äù he pronounced.  ‚ÄúAutomatic appropriations is debt servicing, it clips the power of the purse of the legislative branch. I challenge all senatoriables to take a position on this, unless they are unwitting accomplices of Duterte's treasonous betrayal to China,‚Äù he posed.  Senate Audit of China Loans The lone senate bet of Partido Lakas ng Masa also asked the sitting Senate to ‚Äúimmediately commence a review of all the China loans transacted by the Department of Finance‚Äù, including but not limited to the Chico River deal.  ‚ÄúI recall that the first budget signed by (President Rodrigo) Duterte for 2017 contains a special provision calling for an audit of specific debts. The Congress and Senate would do well to include such provision in the 2020 budget,‚Äù De Guzman said.  De Guzman warns the administration to ‚Äúlearn from the mistakes‚Äù of former President and now House Speaker Gloria Arroyo, who was embroiled in controversies in the $329-million National Broadband Network (NBN) project, the $503-million North Luzon Railways Project Phase 1 and Phase 2 (Northrail), the $884-million South Luzon Railways Project Mainline (Southrail), and the $465-million Cyber Education Project (CEP).  ‚ÄúDuterte‚Äôs designs will be foiled by the people, in the same way Arroyo‚Äôs designs were thwarted before,‚Äù he insisted.  Strengthening ODA Regulations De Guzman adds that it is ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù for existing debts to be audited; the next Congress should also move to ‚Äúclip‚Äù and regulate the President‚Äôs power to contract Official Development Assistance.  ‚ÄúPart of my proposal would include revisions in Republic Act 8182. Specifically, I would insist on a borrowings cap as well as restoring Section 11 of the original  RA 8182, which was modified by RA 8555 to allow creditors to specify modes of procuring labor and other materials,‚Äù he cited.  The labor leader said that the practice of ‚Äútied aid‚Äù, wherein foreign workers and suppliers are tapped for foreign loan funded projects, should be replaced by ‚Äúa system of preference and an obligation to transfer technology Filipino workers as well as competitive and transparent bidding among Filipino suppliers‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe Filipino people will pay for these loans. That being said, I see no reason why Filipino workers and businesses should not benefit from these loans.‚Äù De Guzman ended.###  Reference: Ka Leody de Guzman 0920-5200672 Ka Leody de Guzman Appearances for March 25, 2019 #CreativeName # 23DeGuzman PRESS RELEASE 21 March 2019 Urgent gov't action needed to protect Filipino seafarers - Labor senate bet Partisan Strength sole senatorial bet and labor leader Ka Leody de Guzman called on the Duterte administration for urgent action to protect the jobs and welfare of Filipino seafarers as they are quickly losing their preferential status in the global labor market. The veteran labor leader expressed this alarm after the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) failed to comply with global industry standards set by the International Maritime Organization. De Guzman said the issue of Filipino welfare is personal to him since his youngest son is a seafarer boarding international routes. He said, \"Many families rely on seafarers. Many of them have supported their relatives aboard the ship - albeit worrying about the loss. Not only because of the higher revenues but also because they are comfortable. respect and trust the Filipino seafarers ‚Äù. Filipino seafarers account for 30 percent of the world's seafaring population, according to data released by the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA) from 2016 to 2017. But they are quickly losing this dominant position. De Guzman says the impact of the diqualification will severely impact the economy and their families. Data from the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA) revealed that there were about 378,072 seafarers in 2017 bringing in about $ USD 6 billion in remittances. The issue of non-compliance by Filipino seafarers to global standards is not new. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) last 2017 pointed to deficiencies in the Philippine maritime industry, particularly on maritime education, training and certification systems. The PLM senatoriable stressed, \"The impact of strong government neglect is a threat to our dominant position in the global maritime industry. CHEd has allowed the proliferation of maritime schools to become 'diploma mills' by graduates who have fallen short of the standard. industry. It only targets families hoping to get their children on board. \" De Guzman himself is a graduate of a maritime school, the Philippine Maritime Institute (now PMI Colleges), one of the oldest maritime schools in the country. \"In the matter of certification, we certainly have the perennial problem of corruption. Manning agencies are failing to keep up with changes in global standards. How they remain certified from government agencies is a miraculous price\", he emphasized. The senatorial candidate is the national chair of the Filipino Workers' Union (BMP). He also called on labor groups that are active in organizing seafarers to close ranks and units. \"The AMOSUP (Associated Marine Officers 'and Seamen's Union of the Philippines), PSU (Philippine Seafarers Union), and PTGWO (Philippine Trade and General Workers' Organization) should unite to ensure the welfare of Filipino seafarers in order to maintain their competitiveness in the global market \". ### Reference: Leody de Guzman 0920 5200672 Ka-Leody De Guzman, Senador ng mga Manggagawa!

Press Release 20 February 2019 Right to education is universal, not a carrot on a stick‚Äì labor senate bet Labor leader and senatorial aspirant Leody de Guzman slammed National Youth Commission (NYC) chair Ronald Cardema for asking President Rodrigo Duterte to revoke the scholarships given to students who join protests against government policies. He said the Cardenas‚Äô recommendation is ‚Äúoutright callous, irresponsible, self-serving and unbecoming of the Comission he heads‚Äù. De Guzman, chair of Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino also pointed out to other critics of Cardema which includes Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra and members of Otso Diretso slate that it is not only the right to free expression that the NYC chair infringed but also the universal right to education of the youth. He said that Cardema seems to be ignorant of the mandate of the NYC and is weaponizing the commission by going after student critics of the administration. He  pointed out that the NYC mandate encourages the active participation of the youth in both governmental and non-govermental programs. De Guzman disclosed that Cardema‚Äôs real motive behind his attacks against progressive partylists is because his wife,  Ducielle Marie Suarez-Cardema is the number one nominee of Duterte-Youth partylist. ‚ÄúIf Cardema seeks the youth‚Äôs active role in nation building, the first order of business is to educate them in order to develop a keen political sense and arm them with the tools for critical thinking,‚Äù said the labor bet under Partido Lakas ng Masa. ‚ÄúBy promoting the opposite, he is only galvanizing their belief that this administration is tyrannical and vengeful of critics,‚Äù he added. The labor leader also took a swipe at a statement of Otso Diretso bet Pilo Hilbay who said that scholarships should be based on merit. ‚ÄúI beg to disagree with those holding an elitist perspective on who should receive state subsidies. Everyone should be government scholar. The right to education is universal. Anybody who seeks an education should be automatically provided for and not be discriminated against.   De Guzman stressed that the right to education should never be compromised even under the most autocratic form of government. ‚ÄúThe right to education must have precedence for the very reason that the constitution guarantees that education should be receive the highest allocation in the national budget‚Äù. In a survey conducted in April 2017, only a mere 23% of Filipinos have actually finished college. Also, the labor leader argued that government subsidies for education cannot be used as a carrot on a stick to induce their desired behavior and opinion of the youth on the administration.  ‚ÄúThe scholars owe nothing to the president, Cardema or the senators who have claimed to have championed free education or any other social programs of the government. Those funds the government spends is borne out of the taxes automatically deducted from employees wages,‚Äù De Guzman clarified. The labor leader called on the youth to stand with workers ‚Äì the real benefactors of their education.### Ka Leody and PLM third nominee, Atty Aaron Pedrosa having a healthy discussion with the members of the Moro community in Brgy.

In the coming elections, let us not be blind, deaf, or dumb. Let's take a look at the candidates' faces. Are they still the ones who are getting hurt and are just being voted on in the hope that something will change? It should be scrapped and not recycled. New faces in the Senate are needed. New thoughts. New System. Listen carefully to what the candidates are saying. It may be another ball and our vote is tempted. Let's learn. Don't be dumb on May 13. Announce our desired change with the right vote. Having a ‚ÄúFederally Mandated Living Wage‚Äù and adjusting the tax system in the country, #GenP Federalism has seen a response to Filipino workers raising the minimum wage. According to Generoso, it is not the minimum wage that needs attention but the provision of a living wage. ‚ÄúLet's look at the constitution, not the minimum wage set in the constitution, but living wage. A salary that you will live honorably. Why don't we just talk about minimum wage? Let's talk about living wage. ‚Äù Generoso added that the country's tax system should also be studied. The taxes paid may be the same but the wage level in Manila and the provinces will be greatly affected. ‚ÄúAt the point of federalism, how can we make policy in the field of payroll a problem that is so big now that salaries vary from region to region? But when you use your paycheck when you buy a bottle of VAT with VAT you pay from Aparri to Tawi-tawi is the same 12%. The salary is Tawi-Tawi 280, Metro Manila 537. ‚Äù Generoso explained that in Federalism the Federal Government may set a living wage that can be taxed by each region, or at least be compensated by having a lower Value Added Tax or VAT. Thus, #P Federalism is advancing the grip of Generoso ‚Äî a system of change that will provide opportunity for the common and collective development of every Filipino. #GenP Federalism #GenerosoSaSenado #P FederalismDistanceSaado #DingGeneroso #SenDingSaSenado #MagMajorChangeTayo #PatiyPartyHaving ‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ Federally Mandated Living Wage ‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤ and organizing the country's taxation system is the visible response of the #GenPederalism to raise. According to Generoso, it's not minimum wage that needs to be focused on but giving 'living wage' or just a salary. Let's see what is placed in the constitution, not minimum wage is placed in the constitution, but living wage. A compensation that you will live honorably. Why are we just talking about minimum wage? Let's talk about the living wage. \"Generoso adds, the system of taxation in the country should also be studied. Probably the same tax being paid but there's a huge difference between salary levels in Manila and the provinces.\" At the point of federalism how can a salary problem be a policy in the field of salary that we have big big now for example salary is different from region. But when you use your salary when you buy a bottle of VAT water you pay from Aparri to Tawi-tawi is the same 12%. How about salary in Tawi-Tawi 280 only, Metro Manila 537. \" Generoso's explanation, in federal government can set a living wage that can be given by the region, or can't afford to have a lower Value Added Tax or VAT. That's why #Federalism promotes Generoso-changing system that will give opportunity to the simultaneous development of every Filipino. #GenP Federalism #GenerosoSaSenado #P FederalismDistanceSaado #DingGeneroso #SenDingSaSenado #MagMajorChangeTayo #PatiyaParty # 33GenerosoGenP FederalismSenado # Vote33GenerosoForSenator # Election2019 # Elections2019 Federalism is the key to equal development of all regions of the Philippines.

We walk around and talk to people. They wonder why we are so reluctant to go out on our own and get to them personally. Because of that, I even got a personal campaign manager who knew each salesman and had a place in the market, Rocelle. According to him, it was the first time they had seen a candidate they had personally interviewed. As we cycle, many of us have spoken of almost no confidence in the coming elections. They say they do not want to vote because in their entire lives they see only the same name of the candidates. Despite fancy tv ads or commercials, the sweet promise of each campaign doesn't seem to change their lives. In spite of all their efforts, life has been difficult for most of them. Here we introduce them to the real candidate for May - the system's transformation into Federalism. This word is not new to their ears. Most of them are from Visayas and Mindanao but have been in Manila for decades for a good life. They are ready, to advance it, The people are ready for long. This is what we strive for every day, to bring Federalism to the Senate. Thanks for your belief!

Q: Is there a \"free education?\" # 33GenerosoGenP FederalismSenado # Vote33GenerosoForSenator # Election2019 # Election2019 Q: How do we meet rising commodity prices? The primary reason why commodity prices rise is because we lack the production of our own. What should we do? Increase production, let's industrialize. We need a National Industrialization Plan. Most of the things we buy are imported, so our inflation is erratic because our production is not constant. We need to link up agriculture with our industry. Taxes on products and businesses including VAT and excise tax also need to be adjusted as these add-ons, such as excise tax on fuel, should be eliminated. If prices cannot be prevented, the people's incomes need to be raised to keep up with rising prices. That is the concept of living wage, under the Constitution, not minimum wage. 33 Genetic Federalism for the Senate # 33GenerosoGenP FederalismSensual # Vote33GenerosoForSenator # Election2019 # Election2019 Q: Should Marijuana be legalized? Many studies have been conducted on the medical use of marijuana. It is already proven - there is wealth of medical literature. We need to legalize the use of marijuana especially for terminal cancer patients. Because there are many pain medications when you have terminal 4 cancer, there is no pain medication for you. In fact, the other cure for cancer pain is opium based. But that is highly regulated, the yellow prescription. There are only very few doctors who allow them to prescribe it. Marijuana is a better alternative to opium based medication especially for cancer patients. So for humanitarian reasons, I agree to the have marijuana legalized for medical use. # 33GenerosoGenP FederalismSenado # Vote33GenerosoForSenator # Election2019 # Elections2019 Federalism is the way to break power centered in \"imperial Manila,\" it will also provide enough funds to improve the quality of life of Cebuans and other regions and provinces.

Ano ang living wage? Ito ay income na magbibigay sa'yo at sayo'ng pamilya ng isang buhay na marangal.

Dapat ang living wage ay pareho sa buong bansa, di katulad ngayon na iba-iba  ang minimum wage sa regions. This disparity in wages is aggravated by the uniform  12% VAT across the country. Bakit parehas ang VAT ngayong magka-kaiba ang  sweldo sa bawat rehiyon. Sa ilalim ng Pederalismo, ang living wage na itatakda ng Federal government para sa lahat ay maaring dagdagan pa ng iba't-ibang rehiyon, at ang VAT ay maaring magkaiba rin sa bawat rehiyon base sa kapasidad ng mga mamamayan doon.

Federalism Forum at the National Teacher's College. #PederalismoDalhinSaSenado #33GenerosoGenPederalismoSaSenado #Vote33GenerosoForSenator #PederalismoParaSaYo #Election2019 Federalism Plan B By Amy Pamintuan Philippine Star  Feb 13, 2019 (Excerpts)  There are at least 10 candidates seeking a Senate seat on a federalism platform. One of them, former Concom spokesman Conrado ‚ÄúDing‚Äù Generoso, faced The Chiefs this week on One News / Cignal TV.                      * * * Generoso told us that federalism proponents are now considering Plan B ‚Äì a people‚Äôs initiative to amend the Constitution for a shift to federalism. This has been tried twice before, under Fidel Ramos and GMA. Both ended in the scrap heap amid suspicions that the efforts were meant chiefly to allow the president to stay in power beyond the single six-year term limit. In the case of the signature campaign for a people‚Äôs initiative during GMA‚Äôs presidency, her defense secretary and former chief legal counsel Avelino Cruz described the rushed effort as ‚Äúa legally harebrained idea.‚Äù Nonong Cruz then resigned. Ding Generoso told us that the current push for a people‚Äôs initiative would avoid the weaknesses of the previous efforts. He said it would also exclude certain personalities who gave the past initiatives a bad name. The original idea, he said, was to launch the people‚Äôs initiative alongside the campaign for Senate seats of the 12 candidates (down to 10 after two were disqualified) of his party, the Katipunan ng Kamalayang Kayumanggi. Realizing that this could prove complicated, however, he said they have adjusted their timeline, with the launch envisioned after the May elections, or when the next Congress has convened. *      *      * One achievement of the Concom is that it stimulated public discussion on some of the provisions in the draft Charter, notably the lifting of term limits if an anti-dynasty provision is approved. Federalism and Cha-cha, however, aren‚Äôt the only advocacies of Generoso in case he is elected. Another proposal, which should resonate in this campaign period, is the creation of a common fund to which every taxpayer can contribute voluntarily. Jose de Venecia, when he was House speaker, had made a similar proposal, drawing from practices in other countries. But the common reaction was why taxpayers should bankroll the election campaigns of greedy thieves and incompetent clowns. Aren‚Äôt ordinary people burdened enough? Perhaps some tweaking and different endorsers would make the idea more palatable. Generoso says the common campaign fund can be drawn from taxes collected from personal and corporate income. During tax payment time, a taxpayer can indicate if he wants a portion of his payment to go to the fund, which as the name implies would not go to any specific candidate or party. A multisectoral body would be set up to supervise the fund, for equitable allocation during campaign season as well as transparency in donations and expenditures. If a major company or organization or one of the country‚Äôs wealthiest individuals wants to support a specific candidate or political party, the amount must not be more than 10 percent of any amount that the donor will be required to contribute to the common campaign fund. This, Generoso says, will reduce candidates‚Äô political debts to any individual or interest group. Such debts are usually repaid through sweetheart deals endorsed or directly approved by the winning candidate, or through appointments to government positions even for those lacking qualifications. *      *      * Repaying campaign support is one of the principal sources of corruption and inefficiency in government. Logically, reforming the system would enjoy widespread support. This, of course, is not logical for our politicians. Only a na√Øf leaves a paper trail for campaign donations. Campaign contributions can be a source of enormous personal wealth, and the donations evade the radar of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. It‚Äôs no joke that there are people in this country who seek elective office ‚Äúfor the fund of it.‚Äù Campaign financing is a black hole for the anti-money laundering police. Opaque or non-existent rules allow even drug dealers, smugglers, kidnappers, jueteng lords and other gangsters to finance election campaigns with dirty money. The proposal of Generoso and his fellow federalists on the common campaign fund appears dead in the water. Still, this campaign season is an opportunity to present the idea to voters and allow it to germinate. # 33GenerativeGenP FederalismSenado # Vote33GenerosoForSenator # Election2019 # Elections2019 Let's join #GenP Federalism in # Front 2019 where we will be given the opportunity to declare our platform, and explain our stance on issues facing society, and most of all provide progressive progress They fit.

Carranza of the Ombudsman in the case of Obstruction of Justice. According to his Counter-Affidavit, he had nothing to do with the actual operation of the police and therefore had nothing to do with Red's case. But he also clearly admitted in his response that it was his responsibility - \"to command, supervise and control the elements / units in his area of ‚Äã‚Äãoperation which includes tactical and strategic movements, deployments and placements, among others.\" Since the head of the Rizal Provincial Police Office was unaware of the operation in which Red was killed, the person who approved the operation was his immediate superior and Gen. Edward Carranza. Gen. Carranza was Gen.'s son. Marcelo Garbo who is a staff of YELLOWS. Gen.'s children obeyed him. Carranza is the script from SMARTMATIC to destroy Glenn Chong. Their script would have been perfect. Just in case, Richard Red Santillan passed away. So the culprits disappeared, they tortured and killed Red, and now they are trapped as SMARTMATIC-YELLOW OPERATION. FROM ILOILO CITY...

This is the main issue why we, in the IT Community, say that Comelec is the most unqualified implementor of the AES & Smartmatic is the grossly incompetent contractor for the past 4 elections. But as we speak, data tampering is now on-going due to non-update on Comelec official website and the posting on mainstream media is only at 0.40%.  And yet Comelec has announced for the suspension on the canvassing until 1 pm tomorrow.  So,  WHERE ARE ALL THESE FIGURES COMING FROM ??? THIS IS A CLEAR CASE OF ELECTION FAILURE AND YET COMELEC IS NOT DECLARING IT FOR OBVIOUS REASON. Blockchain advocate running as PH senator Edmundo ‚ÄúToti‚Äù Casi√±o is an information technologist and a Katipunan ng Demokratikong Pilipino candidate for the Philippine senate who believes that blockchain is beneficial for the country. Edmundo ‚ÄúToti‚Äù Casi√±o believes that blockchain technology would bring benefits when applied to the Philippines. This is the comment of the Filipino senatoriable at the second day of the 21st National Convention of the Philippine Society of Information Technology Educators being held at El Circulo Convention Center, Roxas City, Philippines on 22 February 2019.

Isa lang ang dahilan, ang halalan sa Lunes, gamit ay gimmick para magsiraan, kalimutan na ang plano para maglingkod, kung papaano maglilingkod; ang importante ang basura ng kalaban para manalo sa paguunahan sa kaban ng bayan. Mga kababayan, tulungan niyo kami sa KDP para mahinto na ang mga ito at magfocus na tayong nagkaka-isa para sa kinabukasan. Ang inyong lingkod, Edmundo \"Toti\" Casi√±o, numero 18 sa inyong balota, kasama si Butch Valdes (61), RJ Javellana (39), Lady Ann Sahidulla (58), Glenn Chong (21) at Larry Gadon (32), ang inyong Katipunan Ng Demokratikong Pilipino. # 18 Toti Casi√±o speaks:   The first thing I‚Äôll do if I win the elections is get a hearing on the joint oversight Committee and question about the fraud in 2010, 2013, 2016 electoral Smartmatic Comelec. I knew I was called to become a public servant when I was invited, nominated, and they told me the party‚Äôs political agenda which is to stop electoral fraud, oust Smartmatic, [address] the Devangxia scam, and dismantle the control of the oligarchs of public utilities particularly in electricity. The first bill I will file if elected is reform the election automation law and obviously, to suspend the EPIRA [Electric Power Industry Reform Act] law and then strengthen the renewable energy resources. I want to become a senator because there‚Äôs much to be done in this country and it‚Äôs sad that after 33 years of the new constitution, we‚Äôre trailing behind from neighboring countries, and there‚Äôs much we can do as a nation. A principle that I always live by is do what you can do for the good of men. Sacrifice yourself provided you leave something behind for the betterment of their lives. Reports of absentee-voting anomalies are widespread abroad and the face of widespread fraud in the coming elections is likely to be widespread. Meanwhile there was no strong concern from the Comelec. Let us be vigilant, DON'T LET US KEEP US AND MAKE IT DANGER. Be careful and consider in voting. Let us not be carried away by the promises of old politicians that we are repeatedly deceived. Help us at the KDP to MAKE THE COUNTRY OF THE COUNTRY IN OUR VOTE. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157100295066877&id=785241876 Senatoriables Butch Valdes # 61, Rj Javellana # 39, Edmundo Toti Casi√±o # 18 At the Senatorial Forum 2019.

We are together for development! Good luck to us all! They have been taking us for a ride for far too long to sap this country dry. Congress has made Smartmatic and Comelec the sovereign in the land making kings and princes for a fee and paid back with drug money and unbridled corruption. We know how they do it and how to undo them. It is time we take the reins back. Help us regain our Sovereignty on May 13, 2019. This is your Katipunan, our Katipunan, Ang Katipunan ng Demokratikong Pilipino (KDP). Today marks the day Christ rose from the dead. His Life conquered death that whoever believes in Him shall live.  Glory be to God. Victorious is He over the sins of the earth. Enjoy the resurrection of life.  Happy Easter to all !!

He is one of those people who questioned the credibility of Smartmatic and is looking for evidences against the tampering of PICOS machine. He is for the following: a) Electoral Suffrage Reform  b) Science and Technology c) Education d) Amendments of Joint Congressional Oversight  Committee on automated election system e) He has also something to say about the Local Government Code Watch for this link: .....sa ating mga OFW na kasalukuyang ng bumoboto !..... to our OFWs who are currently voting! ..... to our OFWs who are currently voting! ..... to our OFWs who are currently voting! This is not the Spratlys but the BATAAN NUCLEAR PLANT, already paid for by the people. It was laid to waste by the previous administrations since 1986 because Cory Aquino, despite the plea of Marcos to run it for the people, wanted him to be hated as the population suffers.  It is a project that would have cut down electricity costs massively that would have also been a boon even to irrigation. We would have been at par with progressive countries. Instead they forged the EPIRA Law 15 years ago which gave the entire industry to the private sector, stock, lot and barrel and made electricity the most prohibitively expensive in the whole world.  It was supposed to work, but it worked only exclusively to serve the interests of the oligarchs. KDP ALONE, with Butch Valdes, Edmundo Toti Casi√±o, RJ Javellana, LadyAnn Sahidulla, is resolute to have the plant reactivated along with other renewable energy sources and the suspension of the Epira Law. Brillantes supalpal at Toti Casino https://youtu.be/KdcUjfNEUL4 Undaunted by meager means, the indefatigable Prof. Edmundo Toti Casi√±o painstakingly  reaches out to the people he vows to serve. https://m.facebook.com/story.php‚Ä¶ Election is the mother of representative democracy. Rig it and we have nothing but a show of counterfeit patriotism of corrupt politicians whose aims are only to serve themselves and the interests of their true patrons which are not the People.   Prof. Edmundo Toti Casi√±o knows the IT trade by heart and he, along with the other KDP, senatorial candidates Butch Valdes, RJ Javellana and Lady Ann Sahidulla, standing on sound principles, is bent at returning Sovereignty to the People through clean and honest elections, usher Truth, Justice, Peace and Progress. To them, it will be a lifetime commitment that will be passed to the young who truly loves this country. Many, many, many thanks to our angel volunteers !!! https://youtu.be/IrSARCwBOjw ‚ÄúGod chooses the most unlikely messengers‚Ä¶ we must read His message correctly and take advantage of the situation that it has created. Duterte will soon pass but the nation will be better only if we understand why God chose him to lead us  now‚Äù ‚Äì Prof. Antonio Butch Valdes,  Chairman of the KDP, Save The Nation, Citizen National Guard - Senatorial Candidate. However much fanfare has been blown to feign the success of pass administrations,  the bleak reality of the abysmal suffering of the people from the enslavement  of  corruption wrought by greed and lies remain.  Economy was made to appear to soar which the even the average, much less the poor could hardly see, many times not even the posters thereof.  The expensive world-class resorts, casinos and malls have been made the flagship of the economy to conceal  the truth of the rotting populace grimacing in extreme poverty. ‚ÄúThe Philippines was as producer-economy till it was driven to become a service-economy‚Äù says Butch Valdes,  a glum picture of modern-day slavery.  The people have even been trained to become better servants, better slaves whether in the domestic help trade, care-giving, hotel services or out-sourced business processing industry.  When,  in the 70s, skilled workers went abroad to help build nascent wealthy economies such as in the middle east and flies out only for better opportunities, today, the majority of expatriate labour, particularly the women, are in household service leaving their children in the rut and clutches of drug lords that has practically ruled over the masses, not only in the slums but even in  far-flung rural agro-fields.  The privileged, blinded by the hatred of anything that could challenge their fake learning and superiority in the social strata, do not see this and so does  the arrogant millennials raised in lies. While the Katipunan ng Demokratikong Pilipino (KDP)  grimaces in pain that the children, aged twelve and up, are now being rallied to be made criminally liable, it cannot be helped that the cancer has metastasized to levels beyond the reach of the law because of hypocritical policies made by politicians whose faces we only see in pictures with their fake smiles and warmth concealing their true interests namely their own names and the protection of those who perpetuated the drug menace.   The society is broken to its core with the mothers forced to take care of somebody else‚Äôs children with none to take care of their own but the drug-crazed street boys, even their own fathers, grandfathers, uncles and brothers.  In the erudition of Prof. Butch Valdes, depopulation is a reality since the middle of the last century.   We see only the loud horrendous methods of  wars and massacres,  but not the subtle,  more systematic and effective method of starvation,  unaffordable medicines and health care, artificial birth control that targeted the impoverished, the retirees whom  they call ‚Äúthe useless eaters‚Äù .   Have they not been trying to raise retirement age to 65 too and have fought tooth-and-nail the pension hike for too long? The KDP, as led by Prof. Butch Valdes, whose sincerity, resolve and profound understanding of history and the nation‚Äôs stunted growth,  is composed of highly professional true patriots committed to the  principles and goals of the party,  prepared for the rough ride of the campaign on horse-drawn carriages on wooden wheels.   Prof. Edmundo Toti Casi√±oo knows what he is talking about beginning from the people‚Äôs retaking of People‚Äôs  Sovereignty through fair and clean elections to the modern technology  that will drive the country to the future.   RJ Javellana  is immovable in his crusade for the people with his undaunted fight for what is supposed to be a cheaper power sector  that has for the longest time been bled by the oligarchy through the EPIRA Law.  And Lady Ann Sahidulla,  behind her sweet gracious nature,  is a sturdy bridge, a true princess that will bring the benefits of it all to the grassroots of society and for long-lasting peace in the south.  Their victory is not to be gauged by the result of polls on May 13  but on the awakening of the people, the germination of true love for country that will continue to the days and era after Duterte.    The crusade, they vow, will go on.   Chairman Butch Valdes is firm in saying ‚Äúthey can kill Duterte if they can,  but they will never get hold of this country again!  Patayin na nila kung kaya nila, pero hindi nila muling maalipin ang bayang ito!... The Message is greater than the Messenger!‚Äù KDP Meets the Nation's Bloggers (A gathering of the new generation of patriots) 3-28-19 from Cathy Cruz: High hats to Prof. Edmundo Toti Casi√±o! First, he knows the right solution to the people's problems and does not sail among the people and the oligarchs. Second, Prof. Edmundo Toti Casi√±o knows the KDP's stand on this pressing issue of the country. He talks from the heart and is not political. Toti Casino is our #AccessantSenado tonight. Is he passing the job interview with News5 Chief Luchi Cruz-Valdes? https://youtu.be/chG2AFHUoKg WATER CONTROL SHOULD BE GIVEN BACK TO THE GOVERNMENT --- PROF Edmundo Toti Casi√±o  Return d basic utilities back to d Public Domain:... What is the KDP?   Born of true love for country amidst the persistent corruption and hypocrisy that has long plagued the country, the Katipunan ng Demokratikong Pilipino (KDP) is a Filipino political party founded in 2018 which, more than just supporting the beleaguered incumbent President Rodrigo R. Duterte,  is determined to bring back Sovereignty to the People in the true sense of the word. Chaired by former undersecretary of the Department of Education, Prof. Antonio Butch Valdes,  the party combines with alacrity, the aims of both the  Citizen National Guard,  also founded by Butch, a nationalist, anti-communist  and anti all forms of insurgency that do nothing but derail any efforts to usher progress in the country and his other  ‚ÄúSave The Nation Movement‚Äù  that focuses on economic policies geared to save the population from hunger caused by ill-conceptualized and corrupted policies of the previous regimes.   The mission further strengthened with technical and industrial acumen of the people that comprise it. The KDP is founded on principle and galvanized by the people who  support it.  At its helm are Don Ramon Pedrosa as its President, Princess Lady Ann Indanan-Sahidulla, Executive Vice President  and Dr. Ricardo Fulgencio IV.  Katipunan ng Demokratikong Pilipino (KDP)  fields the following  candidates in the May 13, 2019 mid-term elections based not on their popularity but on their undaunted resolve to combat all forms of corruption and usher the country to progress even in the most controversial areas that are usually disparaged  by known personalities with compromised interests. ‚Ä¢ 61  ANTONIO ‚ÄúBUTCH‚Äù VALDES ‚Ä¢18  EDMUNDO ‚ÄúTOTI‚Äù CASI√ëO ‚Ä¢ 21  GLENN CHONG ‚Ä¢ 39  RJ JAVELLANA ‚Ä¢ 58  LADY ANN  SAHIDULLA  ‚Ä¢ 32  GADON, LARRY Katipunan ng Demokratikong Pilipino (KDP)  defines Sovereignty clearly  to really reside in the people which includes their  ability to take charge of their own affairs as they are liberated from the clutches of poverty and manipulative politicians.  It will have to be based on TRUTH, as Butch Valdes articulates, and that includes the truthfulness of elections as valiantly fought for by Edmundo Toti Casi√±o and Glenn Chong.   They vow to return the control to the people and risk their lives to destroy the syndicates that robbed the people of the sacredness of their ballots.  It must be based on JUSTICE without which Truth becomes a lie.  That means bringing to justice those who have ransacked the lives of the people, indeed, the whole nation for years as RJ Javellana has been championing even in the streets, and bringing about economic reforms that should foster DEVELOPMENT as Lady Ann Sahidulla vows to bring to the very grassroots.

Ang ating tugon, patuloy na pagsikapan itulak ang \"Ginhawa ng Bayan!\" Maligayang pagdiriwang ng Araw ng Dabaw! #ArawNgDavao #MrHealthCareInDavao STATEMENT OF SENATOR JV EJERCITO On the Motorcycle Crime Prevention Act or Republic Act No 11235 I want to assure my fellow riders that various images being shared in social media of large metal tin plates in the front and back of motorcycles is not embedded in the law. THE LAW DOES NOT SPECIFY A PARTICULAR SIZE NOR MATERIAL for the plates. I am one with you in opposing anything that will compromise the safety of the riding community which I am proud to say I belong to. As such, I am convening a meeting next week with LTO officials and different rider groups in order to ensure the proper and sensible implementation of the Motorcycle Crime Prevention Act. In that meeting, I intend to duscss the following important issues: 1. While about a third of homicide cases were perpetrated by criminals who take advantage of the convenience of motorcycles, I urge the PNP and the public not to generalize. A great majority of riders are law-abiding, respectful and safety-conscious. 2. I will raise the legitimate concerns expressed by several rider groups and individuals regarding the issue of riders‚Äô safety if the plates to be used are as large as those circulating in social media. I have been riding for a long time and I can tell you that if the plates are that big, it will cause safety issues to the motorcycle riders and the general public. 3. I will urge the LTO and other implementing agencies to draft Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) and come up various options that follows strictly the vision of the law, that is, ‚Äúthe contents of number plates shall be readable from the front, the back, and the side of the motorcycle from a distance of at least 15 meters from the motorcycle (Sec. 5).‚Äù WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE SAFETY OF THE RIDING PUBLIC. 4. I will ask the LTO to include rider organizations and Tricycle Operators and Drivers Associations (TODA) as regular members of the Technical Working Group that will draft the IRR. 5. I am going to personally monitor the drafting of the IRR to ensure that law enforcement officials do not misconstrue or overreact to the original intent of the law. The law did not specify a particular plate size. The plates should not be excessively and ridiculously big rather the increase in the size of the plate from the current ones should simply allow the contents to be readable. 6. I will also strenuously object to any proposals to use metal plates in front of motorcycles because it will compromise the safety of the riders.  In addressing many of our social problems, government needs to weigh the interests of everyone. In pursuing a policy, government needs to make sure that the rights of people are protected. This, I believe, is the principle behind the Motorcycle Crime Prevention Act.  Republic Act No. 11235 is intended to ‚Äúmaintain peace and order‚Äù, ‚Äúsecure and safeguard‚Äù the public by mandating the use of bigger, readable and color-coded number plates.  I assure my fellow riders that I will personally monitor the drafting of the IRR to ensure that while we attempt to stamp out criminality on the streets we also uphold the safety and rights of Filipino riders.

God Respond Albay! # 26Ejercito #MrHealthCareInAlbay #SenJVServes #SenJVParaSaBayan Senator JV Ejercito, chair of the Senate committee on health and demography, said the BFP should give extra attention to hospitals for water ration. ‚ÄúHospitals and medical facilities can‚Äôt afford to run out of water because the lives of the patients would be put in extreme danger,‚Äù Ejercito said. #MrHealthCare #SenJVServes #SenJVParaSaBayan Read more: https://bit.ly/2EX5SVg We will fight to win!

I shared with the Valenzuela locals our continuous efforts to deliver quality health care... from a 200-bed hospital, we have already increased to 500 the bed capacity of the Valenzuela Medical Center. This, apart from an additional 31.5 million peso allocation for additional hospital equipment for the Valenzuela Medical Center. Kudos to our competent young leaders, Valenzuela Mayor Rex Gatchlian, the City Council and the people of Valenzuela!  Maraming salamat po sa mainit na pagtanggap! #26Ejercito #SenJVServes #SenJVParaSaBayan ‚ÄúAng gusto ko kay JV Ejercito, he has the balls to criticize me.

He will talk against issue lang, hindi personality.‚Äù - President Duterte‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ What I like about JV Ejercito, he has the balls to criticize me. That's where I admire this child, if you always say yes sir yes to me, I know that I am just blotting, but if there is something like this, it needs improvement like that. He will talk against issue only, not personality.\"-President Duterte Thank you Brod Sen. Joel Villanueva! This picture was taken 3 years ago. This site obviously is anti-admin, posted it recently making it come out as if I am eating at a carinderia for political gimickry for the 2019 elections.   I was not up for re-election at that time this photo was taken. This is deception. Napaka sinungaling. Not even the cold of the night wind could dampen the warm welcome bestowed on me by more than 3,000 Las Pi√±eros that packed the Pilar Sports Complex during a rally of reelectionist senators here in Las Pinas City. Thank you very much Senator Cynthia Villar for inviting me and giving me this opportunity to personally thank the Las Pi√±eros for their support to the Universal Health Care that I, with your motherly advice and backing, had successfully crafted and now already a law. Sa mga taga Las Pinas, maraming salamat! Sa Universal Health Care law, walang maiiwan na Pilipino sa benepisyo! #26Ejercito #SJVEinLASPI√ëAS #RockatropaInLasPi√±as The UHC program is a game changer in the healthcare system of the country and I'm very happy that after years of really working hard in this measure, now it is finally a law. I would like to thank the President Duterte for trusting us and I'm quite sure that this would be probably one of the flagship programs of this administration.  #UniversalHealthCareBatasNa #SenJVCares Farmers, locals and officials at the Farmers Assembly have welcomed the heat of the season to share best practices in farming in Agusan del Sur Province. I share our ongoing efforts to protect the agricultural sector to ensure a steady supply of food at every table of the Filipino Family. I am very grateful to the residents and local officials of the province under Governor Eddie Bong Plaza. Long live the Agusan Del Sur! Long live the Mindanaoans! # 26Ejercito #SenJVServes #ParaSaBayan Hugpong ng Pagbabago 2019 Campaign Caravan for Senators in Agoo, La Union.  #26SaBalota #SenJVServes #SenJVParaSaBayan Thank you Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University students for the very warm welcome for me and Seatmate Sen. @sonnyangara. REELECTIONIST Senator Joseph Victor \"JV\" Ejercito on Tuesday, February 12, said his campaign to restore the Department of Health‚Äôs (DOH) Health Facilities Enhancement Program or HFEP will pave the way for a P155-million budget for the improvement of various government-run hospitals in Pampanga. Ejercito said that HFEP will enable the completion of vital health infrastructure and equipment as the country is set to implement this year the Universal Health Care Program. He added that it is expected that more people will come into government hospitals for medical services.  #MrHealthCare #SenJVCares Senator JV Ejercito receives the manifesto of support from Aeta leader Virgilio Sanchez, president of the Bamban Aeta Tribal Association, expressing their gratitude as well because of the Senator's Universal Health Care measure.
